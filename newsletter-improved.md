### A Compliance-Preserving Retrieval System for Aircraft MRO Task Search
**Source:** Academic Paper  
**Why it matters:** Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs) spend a significant portion of their time searching manuals, which is a major efficiency bottleneck. This system aims to streamline this process while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.  
**Key Takeaways:** 
- The system uses LLM reranking and semantic search to improve task lookup efficiency.
- Achieves over 90% retrieval accuracy and reduces lookup time from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds.
- Demonstrates the ability to operate within strict regulatory constraints.  
**Summary:** This paper presents a retrieval system that enhances the efficiency of aircraft maintenance operations by significantly reducing the time technicians spend searching for certified procedures. By integrating semantic search with existing legacy systems, it ensures compliance and operational efficiency.

### InfCode-C++: Intent-Guided Semantic Retrieval and AST-Structured Search for C++ Issue Resolution
**Source:** Academic Paper  
**Why it matters:** Existing retrieval systems are predominantly designed for Python, which limits their effectiveness for C++ projects. This paper addresses this gap with a C++-specific solution.  
**Key Takeaways:** 
- Combines semantic code-intent retrieval with AST-structured querying for precise issue resolution.
- Achieves a 25.58% resolution rate, outperforming previous systems by over 10 percentage points.
- Highlights the importance of language-aware reasoning in multi-language software agents.  
**Summary:** InfCode-C++ introduces a novel retrieval system tailored for C++ projects, significantly improving issue resolution rates by leveraging semantic retrieval and structured querying. This advancement underscores the need for language-specific approaches in software development tools.

### Search Is Not Retrieval: Decoupling Semantic Matching from Contextual Assembly in RAG
**Source:** Academic Paper  
**Why it matters:** The paper proposes a new framework that optimizes retrieval systems by separating semantic matching from contextual assembly, enhancing AI system efficiency.  
**Key Takeaways:** 
- Introduces the SINR framework, which improves composability and scalability of retrieval systems.
- Transforms retrieval from a passive to an active process, akin to human information processing.
- Lays the groundwork for next-generation AI systems with enhanced retrieval capabilities.  
**Summary:** This research presents the SINR framework, which decouples semantic matching from contextual assembly, thereby optimizing retrieval processes in AI systems. This approach promises to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of future AI applications.
