[QUERY_ANALYSIS]
- **Restatement**: The user wants an overview of recent content (late 2024–2025) concerning "agentic workflows," specifically looking for definitions, patterns, and industry trends.
- **Domain**: ai_agents
- **Sub-questions**:
  1. What is the foundational definition of "agentic workflows"?
  2. What are the key design patterns emerging in late 2025?
  3. How are enterprises adopting these workflows?
[/QUERY_ANALYSIS]

[SEARCH_NOTES]
- **Tools Used**: `multi_source_research`, `get_recent_articles`, `web_search`, `read_web_page`
- **Key Findings**:
  - **Andrew Ng (Mar 2024)**: Defined the 4 key patterns: Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, Multi-agent collaboration. He emphasized that "agentic workflows" prompt LLMs multiple times to build higher-quality output rather than zero-shot generation. (Relevance: 5/5)
  - **Vellum AI (Sep 2025)**: "The 2025 Guide to AI Agent Workflows" categorizes architectures into Single-Agent (CoT, ReAct) and Multi-Agent (Collaborative, Debate). Defines "agentic" as the ability to take initiative and exert control. (Relevance: 5/5)
  - **GitLab 18.5 Release (Oct 2025)**: Introduces "GitLab Duo Agent Platform" with specific agents (Security Analyst, Planner) that orchestrate tools to automate complex tasks, explicitly using the term "agentic workflows." (Relevance: 5/5)
  - **McKinsey (Oct 2025) & BCG (Nov 2025)**: Strategic reports on the "Agentic Organization." Discuss shifting from "copilots" to "colleagues" and the need to redesign workflows end-to-end. (Relevance: 4/5)
  - **LangChain/ServiceNow (Nov 2025)**: Technical case study on using LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration in customer success. (Relevance: 4/5)

[REFLECTION]
- **Coverage**: Excellent. I have the theoretical foundation (Ng), technical implementation guides (Vellum, LangChain), commercial product launches (GitLab), and high-level strategy (McKinsey, BCG).
- **Gaps**: None. The search results cover the evolution from early 2024 concepts to late 2025 applications.

[FINAL_ANSWER]
Recent posts from late 2024 through late 2025 define **"agentic workflows"** as the shift from using LLMs as simple knowledge engines (zero-shot prompts) to using them as iterative problem-solvers that can plan, critique, and execute multi-step tasks.

The concept, popularized by Andrew Ng in early 2024, has evolved by late 2025 into a concrete engineering discipline and a strategic organizational imperative.

### 1. Core Concept & Design Patterns
**Andrew Ng** identified four foundational patterns that distinguish agentic workflows from standard prompting [Andrew Ng, 2024]:
*   **Reflection**: The model critiques its own output (e.g., code or text) to improve quality before finalizing it.
*   **Tool Use**: The agent determines when to call external functions (web search, code execution) to gather information or take action.
*   **Planning**: The agent breaks a complex goal into a sequence of sub-steps.
*   **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Different agent "personas" (e.g., a Coder and a Reviewer) interact to solve a problem.

By late 2025, **Vellum AI** and other engineering blogs have expanded these into formalized architectures [Vellum, 2025]:
*   **Single-Agent Reasoning**: Patterns like *Chain-of-Thought (CoT)* and *ReAct* where one model loops through reasoning steps.
*   **Multi-Agent Architectures**: Systems where a "Supervisor" agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents (e.g., **LangChain's** work with **ServiceNow** using LangGraph [LangChain, 2025]).

### 2. From "Chatbots" to "Colleagues" (2025 Trends)
The discourse has shifted from "how to build agents" to "how to integrate them as workforce colleagues."
*   **Commercial Implementation**: **GitLab's 18.5 release** (Oct 2025) explicitly markets "agentic workflows" that automate entire domains, such as a *Security Analyst Agent* that triages vulnerabilities and a *Planner Agent* that manages backlogs [GitLab, 2025].
*   **Organizational Shift**: **McKinsey** and **BCG** (Oct/Nov 2025) argue that companies must move beyond "copilots" (assistants) to "agentic organizations" where humans and agents work as a "co-intelligent workforce." This requires redesigning business processes end-to-end rather than just layering AI on top of existing tasks [McKinsey, 2025; BCG, 2025].

### 3. Key Takeaway for Engineers
The consensus across 2025 resources is that **success lies in the workflow, not just the model**. As Andrew Ng famously noted, "GPT-3.5 in an agentic workflow outperforms GPT-4 in a zero-shot prompt." The focus for developers is now on building robust **orchestration layers** (using tools like LangGraph or AutoGen) that allow models to iterate, fail, recover, and collaborate.
