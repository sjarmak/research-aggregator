[REFLECTION]
- **Coverage**: Excellent. I have technical definitions, architectural patterns (Reflection, Planning), specific industry examples (GitLab, Salesforce), and educational resources (Andrew Ng).
- **Gaps**: None. The distinction between "workflow" and "autonomous agent" is a key insight found in multiple sources.

[FINAL_ANSWER]
Recent posts from late 2024 through 2025 highlight a shift from generic "AI agents" toward **"Agentic Workflows"**—structured systems where LLMs dynamically direct the control flow of a task rather than just generating text.

The consensus across recent articles (DeepLearning.AI, Vellum, Weaviate) is that "agentic workflows" are often safer and more reliable for enterprise use than fully autonomous agents because they operate within defined boundaries while still possessing the ability to iterate and correct errors.

### Key Themes in Recent Posts

#### 1. Definition: Workflows vs. Agents
Recent literature draws a sharp distinction between **Autonomous Agents** (which independently plan and execute) and **Agentic Workflows** (where the agent's autonomy is constrained to specific steps in a defined process).
*   **DevCom (May 2025)** notes that agentic workflows are "goal-bound and deterministic to a degree," making them auditable and safer for business logic than "fully autonomous" agents [5].
*   **Weaviate (March 2025)** defines an agentic workflow as a "series of connected steps dynamically executed by an agent," contrasting it with linear, non-agentic "prompt-response" chains [2].

#### 2. Core Design Patterns
Andrew Ng’s DeepLearning.AI and engineering blogs (Vellum, Weaviate) identify four dominant patterns that make a workflow "agentic":
*   **Reflection:** The model critiques its own output (e.g., code review) and iterates to improve it before finalizing.
*   **Tool Use:** The ability to call external APIs (databases, web search) to perform actions.
*   **Planning:** Breaking complex user requests into a sequence of sub-tasks.
*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Different agents with specialized roles (e.g., a "Researcher" and a "Writer") handing off tasks to one another [2, 3].

#### 3. Major Industry Releases (2025)
Several major platforms have launched dedicated "Agentic" features, moving beyond simple chatbots:
*   **GitLab 18.5 (Oct 2025):** Introduced the **Security Analyst Agent** and **Duo Planner**, describing them explicitly as "agentic workflows" that automate vulnerability triage and backlog management [1].
*   **Salesforce Agentforce:** Describes a "Hybrid Reasoning Engine" that keeps agent behaviors predictable [4].
*   **AWS Bedrock AgentCore:** A managed service specifically for building and deploying these secure, bounded agent workflows [4].

#### 4. Educational Resources
*   **Andrew Ng / DeepLearning.AI:** Released the **"Agentic AI"** short course (2025), which is a primary resource for learning to build these patterns from scratch [3].
*   **Vellum.ai:** Published **"The 2025 Guide to AI Agent Workflows,"** which covers emerging architectures and the "AI Agent Stack" needed to debug and trace these complex flows [6].
