[QUERY_ANALYSIS]
- **Restatement**: The user is looking for recent content (blogs, articles, papers) specifically discussing "agentic workflows" to understand current trends and definitions.
- **Domain**: ai_agents
- **Sub-questions**:
  1. What are recent examples of "agentic workflows" in industry blogs?
  2. How is "agentic workflow" defined in recent academic literature (2024-2025)?
  3. What industries are adopting these workflows?
[/QUERY_ANALYSIS]

[SEARCH_NOTES]
- **Tools Used**: `multi_source_research(query="agentic workflows", use_rss=true)`
- **Key Findings**:
  - **Software Development (GitLab)**: A major blog post from Oct 2025 details "GitLab 18.5" introducing "agentic workflows" for vulnerability triage and backlog management. It highlights a shift from simple chat to multi-step orchestration. (Relevance: 5/5)
  - **Geophysics & Energy**: Multiple 2025 papers (EarthArXiv, ADIPEC) discuss "Agentic AI frameworks" for automating complex reservoir characterization. They define these workflows as "collaborative, event-driven multi-agent systems" (e.g., Manager Agents + Worker Agents). (Relevance: 5/5)
  - **Risk & Governance**: A paper on "Prompting Autonomous Agents... Efficiency Gains or Hidden Liabilities?" highlights the governance risks of these workflows. (Relevance: 4/5)
[/SEARCH_NOTES]

[REFLECTION]
- **Coverage**: Excellent. Found both a high-profile software industry example (GitLab) and deep technical implementations in heavy industry (Energy/Geophysics).
- **Gaps**: None. The contrast between "digital" work (software) and "physical" modeling (oil/gas) provides a comprehensive view of the trend.

[FINAL_ANSWER]
Recent posts and literature from late 2025 highlight a shift in AI development from general-purpose chatbots to **"Agentic Workflows."** These are defined not just as autonomous agents, but as structured, multi-step processes where specialized agents collaborate to complete complex, domain-specific tasks.

### Key Trends & Findings

#### 1. Software Development: Intelligent Orchestration
In the software sector, "agentic workflows" are being productized to handle tedious maintenance tasks.
- **GitLab 18.5 (Oct 2025)** introduced native **"Security Analyst Agents"** and **"Planner Agents"**.
- **How it works**: Instead of a human manually clicking through dashboards, an agent orchestrates multiple tools to triage vulnerabilities (e.g., dismissing false positives based on reachability analysis) or organize backlogs.
- **Significance**: This moves AI from a "copilot" (helper) to an "orchestrator" (executor of defined workflows).

#### 2. Heavy Industry: The "Manager-Worker" Architecture
In sectors like Geophysics and Energy, recent papers describe "Agentic AI Frameworks" that mimic human teams to automate scientific analysis.
- **Structure**: A **"Manager Agent"** breaks down a high-level goal (e.g., "analyze reservoir lithology"). It delegates tasks to specialized **"Worker Agents"** (e.g., Data Finder, Analyst, Reporter) that communicate via a shared workspace.
- **Application**: ADNOC's "AiPSO" system embeds these agents into engineering workflows to optimize oilfield production, integrating with Digital Twins for real-time decision support.

#### 3. Emerging Risks: "Hidden Liabilities"
With the rise of these workflows, governance is becoming a critical topic.
- **The Risk**: As workflows become more autonomous ("loops without escalation triggers"), there is a risk of **liability diffusion**—where it becomes unclear if a human or an agent is responsible for a specific decision.
- **Recommendation**: Recent literature calls for "risk-graded frameworks" and strict operational boundaries before letting agentic loops execute critical decisions independently.

### Summary of "Agentic Workflow" Definition
Based on these recent sources, an **Agentic Workflow** is characterized by:
1. **Specialization**: Agents are not generalists; they are "Data Finders," "Security Analysts," or "Planners."
2. **Orchestration**: A distinct "Manager" or workflow engine coordinates the hand-offs between agents.
3. **Tool Use**: Deep integration with external APIs (OSDU, GitLab) rather than just text generation.
