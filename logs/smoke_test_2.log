[FINAL_ANSWER]
Recent posts from November 2025 highlight a shift from experimental agents to robust, platform-integrated **agentic workflows**. Key developments focus on infrastructure for safe execution, deeper integration into DevOps platforms, and multi-agent collaboration in science.

### 1. Platform Integration & DevOps
Major platforms are embedding agentic workflows directly into their ecosystems to reduce context switching and automate complex tasks.
*   **GitLab 18.5 (Oct/Nov 2025)**: Introduced a **Security Analyst Agent** that automates vulnerability triage by orchestrating multiple tools and "agentic workflows." They also opened their "AI Catalog" to third-party agents like Claude and Gemini, allowing them to operate natively within GitLab's CI/CD pipelines [1].
*   **ServiceNow & LangSmith**: A new case study details how ServiceNow uses LangGraph to build customer success agents, emphasizing the need for visibility and monitoring in production agentic workflows [2].

### 2. Infrastructure for Agents
The focus is moving toward the "plumbing" required to run agents safely and reliably.
*   **Cloudflare & Replicate**: Cloudflare announced the integration of Replicate's tools to make their Workers Platform a primary destination for deploying "any AI or agentic workflow," signaling a move toward edge-deployed agents [3].
*   **LangChain DeepAgents**: Released "Sandboxes for DeepAgents," a set of integrations (with Runloop, Daytona, Modal) that allow agents to execute arbitrary code safely in remote environments—a critical requirement for advanced coding and data analysis agents [4].

### 3. Scientific & Research Applications
*   **NVIDIA AI Co-Scientists**: A new post describes "AI co-scientists" for fusion research and cancer treatment. These are architected as **collaborative, multi-agent systems** that can generate hypotheses and analyze data patterns humans might overlook, demonstrating the application of agentic workflows beyond text/code generation [5].

### 4. Foundation Model Updates
*   **OpenAI GPT-5.1**: The release of GPT-5.1 includes specialized capabilities for agents, specifically new `apply_patch` and `shell` tools, optimizing the model for autonomous software engineering tasks [6].
