      "abstract": "We present observations obtained with the Near Infrared Spectrograph on JWST of the five Jupiter Trojans that will be visited by the Lucy spacecraft—the Patroclus–Menoetius binary, Eurybates, Orus, Leucus, and Polymele. The measured 1.7–5.3 μm reflectance spectra, which provide increased wavelength coverage, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio over previous ground-based spectroscopy, reveal several distinct absorption features. We detect a broad OH band centered at 3 μm that is most prominent on the less-red objects Eurybates, Patroclus–Menoetius, and Polymele. An additional absorption feature at 3.3–3.6 μm, indicative of aliphatic organics, is systematically deeper on the red objects Orus and Leucus. The collisional fragment Eurybates is unique in displaying an absorption band at 4.25 μm that we attribute to bound or trapped CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Comparisons with other solar system small bodies reveal broad similarities in the 2.7–3.6 μm bands with analogous features on Centaurs, Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs), and the active asteroid 238P. In the context of recent solar system evolution models, which posit that the Trojans initially formed in the outer solar system, the significant attenuation of the 2.7–3.6 μm absorption features on Trojans relative to KBOs may be the result of secondary thermal processing of the Trojans' surfaces at the higher temperatures of the Jupiter region. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> band manifested on the surface of Eurybates suggests that CO<SUB>2</SUB> may be a major constituent in the bulk composition of Trojans, but resides in the subsurface or deeper interior and is largely obscured by refractory material that formed from the thermophysical processes that were activated during their inward migration.",

      "abstract": "We present new optical reflectance spectra of three potentially silicate-rich trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). These spectra were obtained with the aim of confirming past hints and detections of λ ∼ 0.7 μm absorption features associated with the presence of iron-bearing phyllosilicates. Our new spectrum of 120216 (2004 EW<SUB>95</SUB>) presents clearly detected absorption features that are similar in shape to hydrated mineral absorption bands present in the spectra of aqueously altered outer main belt asteroids. Four new reflectance spectra of 208996 (2003 AZ<SUB>84</SUB>) obtained at separate epochs all appear featureless, but they vary significantly in spectral gradient (between ∼3.5%/0.1 μm and ∼8.5%/0.1 μm) on a timescale consistent with this object's nominal rotational period. We report the first four optical reflectance spectra of 90568 (2004 GV<SUB>9</SUB>), finding them all to be featureless but consistent with colors previously reported for this object. We speculate that impacts are the only mechanism capable of delivering, excavating, or forming hydrated minerals at the surfaces of TNOs in detectable concentrations; as a result, any deposits of hydrated minerals on TNOs are predicted to be localized and associated with impact sites. Globally altered TNOs (as observationally suggested for 2004 EW<SUB>95</SUB>) plausibly formed more easily at smaller heliocentric distances (r <SUB> H </SUB> &lt; 15 au) before being transplanted into the current trans-Neptunian population.",

We present the first spectroscopic observations of Ganymede by the James Webb Space Telescope undertaken in August 2022 as part of the proposal \"ERS observations of the Jovian system as a demonstration of JWST's capabilities for Solar System science\". <BR /> Aims: We aimed to investigate the composition and thermal properties of the surface, and to study the relationships of ice and non-water-ice materials and their distribution. <BR /> Methods: NIRSpec IFU (2.9-5.3 μm) and MIRI MRS (4.9-28.5 μm) observations were performed on both the leading and trailing hemispheres of Ganymede, with a spectral resolution of ~2700 and a spatial sampling of 0.1 to 0.17″ (while the Ganymede size was ~1.68″). We characterized the spectral signatures and their spatial distribution on the surface. The distribution of brightness temperatures was analyzed with standard thermophysical modeling including surface roughness. <BR /> Results: Reflectance spectra show signatures of water ice, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>. An absorption feature at 5.9 μm, with a shoulder at 6.5 μm, is revealed, and is tentatively assigned to sulfuric acid hydrates. The CO<SUB>2</SUB> 4.26-μm band shows latitudinal and longitudinal variations in depth, shape, and position over the two hemispheres, unveiling different CO<SUB>2</SUB> physical states. In the ice-rich polar regions, which are the most exposed to Jupiter's plasma irradiation, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> band is redshifted with respect to other terrains. In the boreal region of the leading hemisphere, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> band is dominated by a high wavelength component at ~4.27 μm, consistent with CO<SUB>2</SUB> trapped in amorphous water ice. At equatorial latitudes (and especially on dark terrains), the observed band is broader and shifted toward the blue, suggesting CO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorbed on non-icy materials, such as minerals or salts. Maps of the H<SUB>2</SUB>O Fresnel peak area correlate with Bond albedo maps and follow the distribution of water ice inferred from H<SUB>2</SUB>O absorption bands. Amorphous ice is detected in the ice-rich polar regions, and is especially abundant on the northern polar cap of the leading hemisphere. Leading and trailing polar regions exhibit different H<SUB>2</SUB>O, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> spectral properties. However, in both hemispheres the north polar cap ice appears to be more processed than the south polar cap. A longitudinal modification of the H<SUB>2</SUB>O ice molecular structure and/or nanometer- and micrometer-scale texture, of diurnal or geographic origin, is observed in both hemispheres. Ice frost is tentatively observed on the morning limb of the trailing hemisphere, which possibly formed during the night from the recondensation of water subliming from the warmer subsurface. Reflectance spectra of the dark terrains are compatible with the presence of Na- and Mg-sulfate salts, sulfuric acid hydrates, and possibly phyllosilicates mixed with fine-grained opaque minerals, with a highly porous texture. Latitude and local time variations of the brightness temperatures indicate a rough surface with mean slope angles of 15°-25° and a low thermal inertia Γ = 20 − 40 J m<SUP>−2</SUP> s<SUP>−0.5</SUP> K<SUP>−1</SUP>, consistent with a porous surface, with no obvious difference between the leading and trailing sides.",

      "abstract": "The Didymos binary asteroid was the target of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which intentionally impacted Dimorphos, the smaller member of the binary system. We used the Near-Infrared Spectrograph and Mid-Infrared Instrument instruments on JWST to measure the 0.6-5 and 5-20 μm spectra of Didymos approximately two months after the DART impact. These observations confirm that Didymos belongs to the S asteroid class and is most consistent with LL chondrite composition, as was previously determined from its 0.6-2.5 μm reflectance spectrum. Measurements at wavelengths &gt;2.5 μm show Didymos to have thermal properties typical for an S-complex asteroid of its size and to be lacking absorptions deeper than ~2% due to OH or H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Didymos' mid-infrared emissivity spectrum is within the range of what has been measured on S-complex asteroids observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope and is most consistent with emission from small (&lt;25 μm) surface particles. We conclude that the observed reflectance and physical properties make the Didymos system a good proxy for the type of ordinary chondrite asteroids that cross near-Earth space, and a good representative of likely future impactors.",

      "abstract": "Carbonaceous chondrites are among the most important meteorite types and have played a vital role in deciphering the origin and evolution of our solar system. They have been linked to low-albedo C-type asteroids, but due to subdued absorption bands, definitive asteroid-meteorite linkages remain elusive. A majority of these existing linkages rely on fine-grained (typically &lt; 45 μm) powders across a limited wavelength range in the visible to near-infrared (0.35-2.5 μm). While this is useful in interpreting the fine-grained regolith of larger main-belt objects like Ceres, recent spacecraft missions to smaller near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), such as Bennu and Ryugu, have shown that their surfaces are dominated by larger grain size material. To better interpret the surfaces of these smaller, carbonaceous NEAs, we obtained laboratory reflectance spectra of seven carbonaceous chondrite meteorite groups (CI, CM, CO, CV, CR, CK, C2-ungrouped) over the ultraviolet to mid-infrared range (0.2-14 μm). Each meteorite contained five grain size bins (45-1000 μm) to help constrain spectral grain size effects. We find a correlation between grain size and absolute reflectance, spectral slope, band depth, and the Christiansen feature band center. Principal component analysis of grain size variation illustrates a similar trend to lunar-style space weathering. We also show that the Bus-DeMeo asteroid taxonomic classification of our samples is affected by grain size, specifically shifting CM2 Aguas Zarcas from a Ch-type to B-type with increasing grain size. This has implications for the parent body of the OSIRIS-REx target, Bennu. With Aguas Zarcas, we present results from Hapke modeling.",

      "abstract": "Remote-sensing observations on the surface of airless bodies, such as the Moon and asteroids, have confirmed the presence of hydrogen-bearing materials. However, their spatial distributions at small scales (mm-m) and depth profiles have great uncertainties. In-situ analyses of hydrogen-bearing materials with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) have been proposed to resolve these problems, as the footprint of LIBS ablation is small (≲1 mm) and can penetrate into the subsurface by excavating the surface layer. Nevertheless, the measurement accuracy of hydrogen with LIBS on airless and hydrous planetary bodies has not been evaluated because it requires extensive calibration using hydrogen-rich geologic materials under a high-vacuum condition. In addition, whether hydrogen occurs as hydroxyl or ice has been difficult to ascertain via LIBS analysis because molecular information is typically lost in the ablation plasma. To resolve these problems, we conducted two experiments. First, compressed powders of rocks were measured by LIBS under vacuum (&lt;3 × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> Pa) to evaluate the calibration accuracies and detection limits in rocks and compacted soils on airless bodies. Several geostandards including basalts and feldspars were doped with various concentrations of hydroxyls (Mg(OH)<SUB>2</SUB> and Ca(OH)<SUB>2</SUB>) to prepare hydrogen-rich samples up to 15 wt% in H<SUB>2</SUB>O-equivalent concentration (wt%H<SUB>2</SUB>O). Our results show that the hydrogen concentration can be accurately calibrated from the LIBS spectra by using multivariate models or matrix-matched calibration curves (i.e., calibration using samples with comparable bulk elemental abundances), facilitating the correction of significant matrix effects observed in the intensities of the 656 nm Hα line. We obtained a measurement accuracy of ±0.9 wt%H<SUB>2</SUB>O in the 0-12 wt%H<SUB>2</SUB>O range via matrix-matched calibration. This level of accuracy is sufficient for many planetary and resource exploration applications, such as designing hardware and operation for mining water on the Moon. We estimate the 2σ limit of detection (LOD) to be 0.4 wt%H<SUB>2</SUB>O based on the average of all samples, although better LODs were obtained for some individual matrix (e.g., 0.2 wt%H<SUB>2</SUB>O for basalt/feldspar-Ca(OH)<SUB>2</SUB> mixtures). Such LOD shows that exploitable ice on the Moon can be detected with 2σ confidence by LIBS. Second, we demonstrate that the molecular structure of hydrogen can be distinguished by operating LIBS in tandem with heating lasers. In this method, the samples are heated prior to LIBS analysis using a continuous-wave laser with adjusted fluence and duration. Our results indicate that ice and hydroxyl can be distinguished because the Hα lines of ice-bearing samples decrease after the laser heating due to sublimation, but those of hydroxyl-bearing samples are retained. In addition, we report an enhancement of hydrogen emission from loose powders, suggesting that hydrogen in lunar soils may be measured with higher sensitivity. The results of this study show that LIBS is a versatile and powerful tool for accurate stand-off measurement of hydrogen-bearing materials on airless planetary bodies.",

      "abstract": "Main-belt comets are small Solar System bodies located in the asteroid belt that repeatedly exhibit comet-like activity (that is, dust comae or tails) during their perihelion passages, strongly indicating ice sublimation<SUP>1,2</SUP>. Although the existence of main-belt comets implies the presence of extant water ice in the asteroid belt, no gas has been detected around these objects despite intense scrutiny with the world's largest telescopes<SUP>3</SUP>. Here we present James Webb Space Telescope observations that clearly show that main-belt comet 238P/Read has a coma of water vapour, but lacks a significant CO<SUB>2</SUB> gas coma. Our findings demonstrate that the activity of comet Read is driven by water-ice sublimation, and implies that main-belt comets are fundamentally different from the general cometary population. Whether or not comet Read experienced different formation circumstances or evolutionary history, it is unlikely to be a recent asteroid belt interloper from the outer Solar System. On the basis of these results, main-belt comets appear to represent a sample of volatile material that is currently unrepresented in observations of classical comets and the meteoritic record, making them important for understanding the early Solar System's volatile inventory and its subsequent evolution.",

      "abstract": "Solar System small bodies were the first objects to accrete inside the protoplanetary disk, giving insights into its composition and structure. The P-/D-type asteroids are particularly interesting because of the similarity of their spectra, at visible and near infrared wavelengths (Vis-NIR), with cometary nuclei, suggesting that they are the most primitive types of small bodies. There are various indications that (1) their low albedo in the visible (Vis) and mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength ranges seems mainly controlled by the presence of opaque minerals (iron sulfides, Fesbnd Ni alloys etc.) (Quirico et al., 2016; Rousseau et al., 2018); and (2) their surfaces are made of intimate mixtures of these opaque minerals and other components (silicates, carbonaceous compounds, etc.) in the form of sub-micrometre-sized grains, smaller than the wavelength at which they are observed, so-called \"hyperfine\" grains. Here, we investigate how the Vis-NIR-MIR (0.55-25 μm) spectral and V-band (0.53 μm) polarimetric properties of surfaces made of hyperfine grains are influenced by the relative abundance of such hyperfine materials, having strongly different optical indexes. Mixtures of grains of olivine and iron sulfide (or anthracite), as analogues of silicates and opaque minerals present on small bodies, were prepared at different proportions. The measurements reveal that these mixtures of hyperfine grains have spectral and polarimetric Vis-NIR properties varying in strongly nonlinear ways. When present at even a few percent, opaque components dominate the Vis-NIR spectral and polarimetric properties, and mask the silicate bands at these wavelengths. The Vis-NIR spectral slope ranges from red (positive slope), for pure opaque material, to blue (negative slope) as the proportion of silicates increases, which is reminiscent of the range of spectral slopes observed on P/D/X/C- and B-types asteroids. The spectra of the darkest mixtures in the Vis-NIR exhibit the absorption bands of Sisbnd O in olivine around 10 μm in the MIR, which is observed in emission for several small bodies. The samples studied here have macro- and micro-porosities lower than 78%, indicating that surfaces more compact than \"fairy castle\" hyperporous (80-99%) ones can also exhibit a blue spectral slope or a silicate signature at 10 μm. Remarkably, some mixtures exhibit altogether a red spectral slope in the Vis-NIR, a 10-μm feature in the MIR, and a V-band polarimetric phase curve similar (but not identical) to P-/D-type asteroids, reinforcing the hypothesis that these bodies are made of powdery mixtures of sub-micrometre-sized grains having contrasted optical indexes. This work shows that both the contrasted optical indexes of the components, and the dispersion or aggregation -depending on their relative proportions- of their hyperfine grains, induce different light scattering regimes in the Vis-NIR and MIR, as observed for primitive small bodies. The optical separation of hyperfine grains seems to be a major parameter controlling the optical properties of these objects.",

      "abstract": "Identification of water in our Solar System is a key point to understanding the formation and evolution of planetary bodies as well as for astrobiological studies. Scientists identified hydrated minerals as a prime source of H<SUB>2</SUB>O in our Solar System. Minerals such as clays, serpentines and other phyllosilicates were discovered by orbiter and lander spacecraft and ground observations on a large variety of rocky surfaces from Mars to small asteroids using InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy as primary technique. It has already been observed that in the presence of large amounts of hydrated minerals in mixtures with anhydrous minerals, the IR spectra can be dominated by the features of hydrated minerals. However, it is still poorly studied how the IR spectra change in presence of different grain size of the two components. <P />The goal of this study was to investigate the infrared spectroscopic features of anhydrous mineral spectra in presence of low amounts of small grain size hydrated hyperfine particles. We prepared several mixtures using 1 wt% and 5 wt% of very small grain size (&lt; 10 μm) hydrated minerals and 95 wt% and 99 wt% of larger grain size (200-500 μm) anhydrous minerals. We measured the IR reflectance spectrum of these mixtures in the range 8000-400 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (1.25-25 μm). Results presented here show how the presence of a very limited amount of hydrated minerals with grain size one order of magnitude smaller than the anhydrous component is sufficient to change the IR spectrum, especially in the Near-InfraRed (NIR) region where some of the major hydrated features manifest. On the contrary, the Mid-InfraRed (MIR) part of the spectrum (also identified as thermal infrared) is definitely less affected and anhydrous mineral features continue to be dominant with slight modifications. This result is of pivotal importance for correctly interpreting the IR reflectance observations of planetary bodies such as Mars or asteroids where a mixing of anhydrous and hydrated minerals can be observed. The presence of strong spectroscopic features due to hydrated minerals can be misinterpreted as a large abundance of this material instead of a spectroscopic effect.",

However, as ECs and IMs generally lack absorption characteristics, distinguishing their parent bodies by spectroscopy generally poses a challenge. <BR /> Aims: We aim to develop a method to distinguish two kinds of M-type asteroids, the parent bodies of ECs and IMs, and to infer their composition. <BR /> Methods: We measured the visible to near-infrared (VIS-NIR) reflectance spectra of aubrite, ECs, and IMs. Then we analyzed and compared their spectral parameters, such as the reflectance at 0.55 µm (R<SUB>0.55</SUB>), absorption bands, and spectral slopes. We also compared the geometric albedo and spectral slopes of a total of 13 E-type and 14 M-type asteroids. Furthermore, combining the collected radar albedo and density data of M-type asteroids, we discuss their potential composition at different depths. <BR /> Results: We find that for most meteorites, with the exception of very weak absorption in an aubrite and an EH7 chondrite, ECs and IMs do not show any absorption characteristics. Aubrite shows extremely high reflectance and a negative near-infrared slope (NIRS) and ECs show relatively low reflectance and moderately positive NIRS, while IMs show relatively moderate reflectance and the steepest positive NIRS. Two diagrams plotting with R<SUB>0.55</SUB> and NIRS calculated in the 1.1-1.2 µm and 1.1-1.4 µm bands were subsequently shown to perform optimally at distinguishing aubrite, ECs, and IMs. In addition, M-type asteroids have a wide range of NIRS and diverse radar albedo and densities, whereby 16 Psyche shows high NIRS, radar albedo, and density, while 21 Lutetia is dominated by low values for these parameters. <BR /> Conclusions: We demonstrate that NIRS is correlated with metal content and increases with metal content. In particular, the NIRS calculated in the 1.1-1.4 µm band is a potentially useful parameter for inferring the surface metal content of E- and M-type asteroids. Based on our results, we suggest that the featureless M-type asteroids ought to be divided into two subtypes: Mm- (e.g., 16 Psyche) and Me-type (e.g., 21 Lutetia) in the aim of characterizing the sources of IMs and ECs, respectively.",

      "abstract": "H<SUB>2</SUB>O and OH are readily detected in hydrated minerals in CM chondrites via reflectance spectroscopy due to their characteristic vibration absorptions at infrared wavelengths. Previous spectroscopic work on bulk powdered CM chondrites has shown that spectral parameters, like the wavelength position of the \"3 μm absorption feature,\" vary systematically with the extent to which the samples have been aqueously altered. However, it is yet unclear how these spectral features may vary across an intact meteorite chip when measured at spatial scales smaller than that of the individual components of the meteorite. Here, we explore the spatial variability of this spectral feature and others on intact CM2 chips which, unlike powders, retain their petrologic and textural characteristics. We also model the modal mineralogy of the bulk meteorite powders and correlate this with key spectral features, demonstrating that microscope Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic mapping provides a powerful, rapid, and non-destructive technique for assessing compositional diversity and variations in water-rock interactions in chondritic planetary materials. In all CM2 chondrites studied here, we find that variations in the position, shape, and strength of the 3 μm absorption feature reveal a single chondrite can exhibit as much spectral variation as the entire suite of CM2 chondrites. The observed variations in the position and shape of the 3 μm feature within individual CM2 chondrite chips suggest a range of alteration products (e.g., Mg-rich to Fe-rich phyllosilicates) are present and record sub-mm scale variations in the amount and/or chemistry of the altering fluids. The samples having experienced the most progressive aqueous alteration show the least amount of variability in features like the 3 μm absorption band minimum position, whereas the least altered samples exhibit the most variability. We also find that the bulk spectral signatures in the least altered samples appear to be biased toward the spectral signatures of clasts versus matrix. By extension, asteroid reflectance spectra exhibiting 3 μm absorption features consistent with those measured here may be interpreted in a similar framework in which the spectrum of what may appear to be the least altered asteroids represents an average that belies the true diversity of mineralogy and chemistry of the body.",

      "abstract": "Infrared measurements of asteroids are crucial for the determination of physical and thermal properties of individual objects, and for understanding the small-body populations in the solar system as a whole. However, standard radiometric methods can only be applied if the orbit of an object is known, hence its position at the time of the observation. With JWST-MIRI observations the situation will change and many unknown, often very small, solar system objects will be detected. Later orbit determinations are difficult due to the faintness of the objects and the lack of dedicated follow-up concepts. We present MIRI observations of the outer-belt asteroid (10920) 1998 BC1 and an unknown object, detected in all nine MIRI bands in close apparent proximity to (10920). We developed a new method called STM-ORBIT to interpret the multi-band measurements without knowing the object's true location. The power of the new technique is that it determines the most-likely heliocentric and observer-centric distance and phase angle ranges, allowing us to make a radiometric size estimate. The application to the MIRI fluxes of (10920) was used to validate the method. It leads to a confirmation of the known radiometric size-albedo solution, and puts constraints on the asteroid's location and orbit in agreement with its true orbit. To back up the validation of the method, we obtained additional ground-based light curve observations of (10920), combined with Gaia data, which indicate a very elongated object (a/b ≥ 1.5), with a spin-pole at (λ, β)<SUB>ecl</SUB> = (178°, +81°), with an estimated error of about 20°, and a rotation period of 4.861191 ± 0.000015 h. A thermophysical study of all available JWST-MIRI and WISE measurements leads to a size of 14.5-16.5 km (diameter of an equal-volume sphere), a geometric albedo p<SUB>V</SUB> between 0.05 and 0.10, and a thermal inertia in the range 9-35 (best value 15) J m<SUP>−2</SUP> s<SUP>−0.5</SUP> K<SUP>−1</SUP>. For the newly discovered MIRI object, the STM-ORBIT method revealed a size of 100-230 m. The new asteroid must be on a low-inclination orbit (0.7° &lt; i &lt; 2.0°) and it was located in the inner main-belt region during JWST observations. A beaming parameter η larger than 1.0 would push the size even below 100 meters, a main-belt regime that has escaped IR detections so far. This kind of MIRI observations can therefore contribute to formation and evolution studies via classical size-frequency studies, which are currently limited to objects larger than about one kilometer in size. We estimate that MIRI frames with pointings close to the ecliptic and short integration times of only a few seconds will always include a few asteroids; most of them will be unknown objects.",

Variations in radar reflectivity, density, thermal inertia, and visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra of Psyche suggest a highly metallic composition with mafic silicate minerals (e.g., pyroxene) heterogeneously distributed on the surface in low abundance (&lt;10 vol.%). The Psyche spacecraft's Multispectral Imager is designed to map ≥80% of the surface at high spatial resolution (≤20 m/pixel) through a panchromatic filter and provide compositional information for about ≥80% of the surface using seven narrowband filters at VNIR wavelengths (∼400-1,100 nm) and at spatial scales of ≤500 m/pixel. We analyzed 359 reflectance spectra from samples consistent with current uncertainties in Psyche's composition and compared them to published reflectance spectra of the asteroid using a chi-square test for goodness of fit. The best matches for Psyche include iron meteorite powder, powders from the sulfide minerals troilite and pentlandite, and powder from the CH/CBb chondrite Isheyevo. Comparison of absorption features support the interpretation that Psyche's surface is a metal-silicate mixture, although the exact abundance and chemistry of the silicate component remains poorly constrained. We convolve our spectra to the Imager's spectral throughput to demonstrate preliminary strategies for mapping the surface composition of the asteroid using filter ratios and reconstructed band parameters. Our results provide predictions of the kinds of surface compositional information that the Psyche mission could reveal on the solar system's largest M-type asteroid.",

We have started a program to extract those observations in order to obtain constraints on asteroid size and albedo.

Over the mission lifetime, we expect to assemble a sizable catalog, extending our knowledge of asteroid sizes and albedos to sub-km MBAs. <P />We limit our search to asteroids that were discovered otherwise. Due to MIRI's unprecedented sensitivity, the dataset is teeming with previously unknown asteroids. Their sizes will be measured once they're discovered using other assets. <P />The figure shows a MIRI commissioning observation with 4 dither points using filter F1500W (some 15 micron).

S-complex (including V-type) NEAs were not expected to contain OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on their surfaces because they formed in the anhydrous regions of the solar system and their surface temperatures are high enough to remove these volatiles. However, a 3 μm feature typically indicative of OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O was identified on other seemingly dry bodies in the inner solar system, raising the question of how widespread volatiles may be on NEAs. We observed 29 NEAs using both prism (0.7-2.52 μm) and LXD_short (1.67-4.2 μm) modes on SpeX on NASA's IRTF in order to accurately characterize asteroid spectral type and the 3 μm region. Eight of the observed NEAs have a 3 μm absorption feature at &gt;1σ (three of which are present to &gt;2σ), and they exhibit four identified band shape types. Possible sources for OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impacts and/or interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. Characteristics such as composition and aphelion appear to play an important role in the delivery and/or retention of OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O, as all eight NEAs with an absorption feature are S-complex asteroids and six enter the main asteroid belt. Additionally, perihelion, size, albedo, and orbital period may play a minor role. Our observations determined that nominally anhydrous, inner solar system bodies, and therefore near-Earth space in general, contain more OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O than previously expected. The identified trends should help predict which NEAs that have not yet been observed might contain OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on their surfaces.",

Following published methods, we identified IMBPs in the inverse size versus semimajor axis (α) space, after the removal of all asteroids belonging to collisional families. <BR /> Methods: We conducted several ground-based observational campaigns of these IMBPs in the visible range at the 1.82 m Asiago telescope, and in the near-infrared range at the Telescopio Nationale Galileo, the Lowell Discovery Telescope, and the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility telescopes. As several of the identified planetesimals already have spectra published in the literature, we collected all the available data and focused the telescope time to investigate those never observed before, or to complete the 0.45-2.5 μm range spectrum for those for which there is only partial spectral coverage or data with poor signal-to-noise ratio. In this way, we obtained new spectra for 24 IMBPs. Combining new and literature observations, we present spectra for 60 IMBPs in both the visible and near-infrared range, and 4 IMBPs in the visible only. All spectra were classified following well-established taxonomies. We also characterized their spectral absorption bands - when present -, their spectral slopes, and their mineralogy. In addition, we performed curve matching between astronomical and laboratory spectra in order to identify the closest meteorite analog using the RELAB database. <BR /> Results: The majority of the IMBPs belong to the S-complex; the latter are best matched with ordinary chondrite meteorites, and their olivine/(olivine and pyroxene) abundance ratio is not correlated with the semi-major axis. This result does not support the hypothesis that this ratio increases with heliocentric distance. Furthermore, ~27% of the IMBPs belong to the C-complex, where Ch/Cgh types dominate, meaning that most of the carbonaceous-rich planetesimals were aqueously altered. These are best fitted by CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Finally, the remaining IMBPs (~20%) belong to the X-complex, and have various mineralogies and meteorite matches, while a few are end-member classes, including L-, K-, V-, and D- or T-types. <BR /> Conclusions: Our spectroscopic investigation of IMBPs confirms that silicate-rich bodies dominated the inner main belt where temperature has permitted the condensation of silicate rocks. However, almost all the spectral types are found, with the notable exception of olivine-rich A-types and Q-type asteroids. Their absence, as well as the absence of the R- and O-types among planetesimals, might be due to the rarity of these types among large asteroids. However, the absence of Q-types among primordial planetesimals is expected, as they have undergone surface rejuvenating processes. Therefore, Q-types have relatively young and less weathered surfaces compared to other types. Our results support the hypothesis of compositional mixing in the early Solar System. In particular, the fact that most of the C-complex planetesimals are aqueous altered, and the presence of three D- or T-type asteroids among them indicate that these bodies migrated from beyond 3 au to their current position.",

Our modeling is focused on capturing the diurnal and seasonal surface temperature variations caused by 16 Psyche's large obliquity (95°) and moderately high eccentricity (0.134). Using a semianalytic framework, we predict that large thermal variations (including at the poles) can cause cracking of boulders leading to a porous surface regolith. This prediction is consistent with a high-porosity surface regolith inferred from thermal inertia measurements. We also find that water ice is not likely to be stable at any latitude.",

Using spectral features such as absorption bands and spectral curvature, we identify spectral matches between 500 asteroid spectra and over 1,000 samples of RELAB meteorite spectra over visible plus near-infrared wavelengths (0.45- 2 . 5 μm). We reproduce and confirm many major and previously known meteorite-asteroid connections and find possible new, more rare or less-established connections. Well-established connections include: ordinary chondrites with S-complex asteroids; pristine CM carbonaceous chondrites with Ch-type asteroids and heated CMs with C-type asteroids ; HED meteorites with V-types; enstatite chondrites with Xc-type asteroids; CV meteorites with K-type asteroids; Brachinites, Pallasites and R chondrites with olivine-dominated A-type asteroids. <P />In addition to the link between ordinary chondrite meteorites with S-complex asteroids, we find a trend from Q, Sq, S, Sr to Sv correlates with LL to H, with Q-types matching predominately to L and LL ordinary chondrites, and Sr and Sv matching predominantly with L and H ordinary chondrites. We find ordinary chondrite samples that match to the X-complex. These are measurements of slabs and many are labeled as dark or black (shocked) ordinary chondrites. We find carbonaceous chondrite samples having spectral slopes large enough to match D-type asteroid spectra. <P />We find in many cases the asteroid type to meteorite type links are not unique, for classes with and without distinct spectral features. While there are examples of dominant matches between an asteroid class and meteorite class that are well established, there are less common but still spectrally compatible matches between many asteroid types and meteorite types. This result emphasizes the diversity of asteroid and meteorite compositions and highlights the degeneracy of classification by spectral features alone requiring additional measurements to firmly establish asteroid-meteorite links. Recent and upcoming spacecraft missions will shed light on the compositions of many of the asteroid classes, particularly those without diagnostic features, (C-, B-, X-, and D-types), with measurements of C-type Ceres, C-type Ryugu, B-type Bennu, M-type Psyche, and C-, P-, and D-types as part of the Lucy mission.",

Whereas the mass of Kalliope is already well constrained thanks to the presence of a moon, its volume is still poorly known, leading to uncertainties on its bulk density and internal structure. <BR /> Aims: We aim to refine the shape of (22) Kalliope and thus its diameter and bulk density, as well as the orbit of its moon to better constrain its mass, hence density and internal structure. <BR /> Methods: We acquired disk-resolved observations of (22) Kalliope using the VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument to reconstruct its three-dimensional (3D) shape using three different modeling techniques. These images were also used together with new speckle observations at the C2PU/PISCO instrument as well as archival images from other large ground-based telescopes to refine the orbit of Linus. <BR /> Results: The volume of (22) Kalliope given by the shape models, corresponding to D = 150 ± 5 km, and the mass constrained by its satellite's orbit yield a density of ρ = 4.40 ± 0.46 g cm<SUP>−3</SUP>. This high density potentially makes (22) Kalliope the densest known small body in the Solar System. A macroporosity in the 10-25% range (as expected for this mass and size), implies a grain density in the 4.8-5.9 g cm<SUP>−3</SUP> range. Kalliope's high bulk density, along with its silicate-rich surface implied by its low radar albedo, implies a differentiated interior with metal contributing to most of the mass of the body. <BR /> Conclusions: Kalliope's high metal content (40-60%) along with its metal-poor mantle makes it the smallest known Mercury-like body. A large impact at the origin of the formation of the moon Linus is likely the cause of its high metal content and density. <P />Reduced images are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/662/A71\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/662/A71</A> <P />Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under program ID 199.C-0074 (PI: P.

Motivated by this, here we fit a model to the same ALMA data set that allows dielectric constant and thermal inertia to vary across the surface. We find that Psyche has a heterogeneous surface in both dielectric constant and thermal inertia but, intriguingly, we do not observe a direct correlation between these two properties over the surface. We explain the heterogeneity in dielectric constant as being due to variations in the relative abundance of metal and silicates. Furthermore, we observe that the lowlands of a large depression in Psyche's shape have distinctly lower thermal inertia than the surrounding highlands. We propose that the latter could be explained by a thin mantle of fine regolith, fractured bedrock, and/or implanted silicate-rich materials covering an otherwise metal-rich surface.

The project will determine Psyche's origin and formation by measuring any strong remanent magnetic fields, which would imply it was the core of a differentiated body; the scale of metal to silicate mixing will be determined by both the neutron spectrometers and the filtered images; the degree of disruption between metal and rock may be determined by the correlation of gravity with composition; some mineralogy (e.g., modeled silicate/metal ratio, and inferred existence of low-calcium pyroxene or olivine, for example) will be detected using filtered images; and the nickel content of Psyche's metal phase will be measured using the GRNS.",

      "abstract": "Some M-type asteroids have measured bulk densities much lower than expected based on their metal-rich surfaces. In particular, the density of the largest M-type asteroid 16 Psyche would require a bulk porosity of ∼52 vol% if it has a pure iron composition. We determine that a pure iron Psyche must have cooled to and remained below 800 K to maintain sufficient porosity for that porosity to persist until present. Iron bodies smaller than Psyche could preserve long-lived high porosities (&gt;40%), yet even the smallest M-type asteroids would require temperatures below 925 K. Our results indicate that all iron asteroids must cool to and remain at low temperatures prior to a porosity-adding event in order to retain porosity on timescales longer than a few million years. Accordingly, a pure iron Psyche would not have sufficiently cooled to retain high porosities when large porosity adding events are most likely to have occurred in the early solar system. Hence, Psyche is not likely to be a pure iron exposed core. However, this structure may be more viable for M-type asteroids smaller than Psyche which cool more quickly.",

On the largest airless bodies of the inner solar system (Mercury, the Moon, Ceres), water can be an exospheric species but also occurs in its condensed form. Mercury hosts water ice deposits in permanently shadowed regions near its poles that act as cold traps. Water ice is also present on the Moon, where these polar deposits are of great interest in the context of future lunar exploration. The lunar surface releases either OH or H<SUB>2</SUB>O during meteoroid showers, and both of these species are generated by reaction of implanted solar wind protons with metal oxides in the regolith. A consequence of the ongoing interaction between the solar wind and the surface is a surficial hydroxyl population that has been observed on the Moon. Dwarf planet Ceres has enough gravity to have a gravitationally-bound water exosphere, and also has permanently shadowed regions near its poles, with bright ice deposits found in the most long-lived of its cold traps. Tantalizing evidence for cold trapped water ice and exospheres of molecular water has emerged, but even basic questions remain open. The relative and absolute magnitudes of sources of water on Mercury and the Moon remain largely unknown. Exospheres can transport water to cold traps, but the efficiency of this process remains uncertain. Here, the status of observations, theory, and laboratory measurements is reviewed.",

While recent evidence has collected against a pure metal composition for Psyche, its spectrum and radar properties remain anomalous. We observed (16) Psyche in thermal emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at a resolution of 30 km over two-thirds of its rotation. The diurnal temperature variations are at the ~10 K level over most of the surface and are best fit by a smooth surface with a thermal inertia of 280 ± 100 J m<SUP>-2</SUP> K<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1/2</SUP>. We measure a millimeter emissivity of 0.61 ± 0.02, which we interpret via a model that treats the surface as a porous mixture of silicates and metals, where the latter may take the form of iron sulfides/oxides or, alternatively, conducting metallic inclusions. The emissivity indicates a metal content of no less than 20% and potentially much higher, but the polarized emission that should be present for a surface with ≥20% metal content is almost completely absent. This requires a highly scattering surface, which may be due to the presence of reflective metallic inclusions. If such is the case, a consequence is that metal-rich asteroids may produce less polarized emission than metal-poor asteroids, exactly the opposite prediction from standard theory, arising from the dominance of scattering over the bulk material properties.",

Quantifying the hydration of asteroids is necessary to constrain models of the formation and evolution of the Solar System and the origin of Life on Earth. The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) mission showed that near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu contains widespread, abundant hydrated phyllosilicates, indicated by a ubiquitous absorption at ~ 2.7 μm. The objective of this work is to quantify the hydration-that is, the hydrogen content-of phyllosilicates on Bennu's surface and investigate how this hydration varies spatially. We analyse spectral parameters (normalized optical path length, NOPL; effective single-scattering albedo, ESPAT; and Gaussian modeling) computed from the hydrated phyllosilicate absorption band of spatially resolved visible-near-infrared spectra acquired by OVIRS (the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer). We also computed the same spectral parameters using laboratory-measured spectra of meteorites including CMs, CIs, and the ungrouped C2 Tagish Lake. We estimate the mean hydrogen content of water and hydroxyl groups in hydrated phyllosilicates on Bennu's surface to be 0.71 ± 0.16 wt%. This value is consistent with the hydration range of some aqueously altered meteorites (CMs, C2 Tagish Lake), but not the most aqueously altered group (CIs). The sample collection site of the OSIRIS-REx mission has slightly higher hydrogen content than average. Spatial variations in hydrogen content on Bennu's surface are linked to geomorphology, and may have been partially inherited from its parent body.",

Techniques that unambiguously detect water on asteroids can be used to identify targets for exploration and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and could be used to better understand how water was delivered to Earth. Asteroid hydration is typically determined through detections of the near-infrared (NIR) 3-micron absorption feature; however, interpretation of this spectral feature is complicated by the need for thermal corrections to NIR data, telluric lines in our atmosphere, and the proximity of the OH (2.8 microns) and H2O (3 microns) spectral absorption features. In the far-ultraviolet (FUV), however, water produces a strong spectral edge causing a significant difference in albedo shortward and longward of 165 nm. We propose to conduct observations of five M-type asteroids using the FUV COS G140L mode to 1) evaluate if the hydrated sub-class of the M-type asteroids are in fact hydrated or are otherwise different from the non-hydrated, presumably metallic M-types; and 2) determine if this hydration is due to OH or H2O, since only H2O is expected to produce the strong FUV spectral signature. Only three asteroids have ever been observed at wavelengths &lt;180 nm, so this proposed program would significantly increase the database of FUV asteroid observations while also verifying if the FUV can be used to unambiguously detect water or water-bearing minerals on asteroid surfaces.",

Despite gaining considerable interest in the scientific community, Psyche's composition and formation remain unconstrained. Originally, Psyche was considered to be almost entirely composed of metal due to its high radar albedo and spectral similarities to iron meteorites. More recent telescopic observations suggest the additional presence of low-Fe pyroxene and exogenic carbonaceous chondrites on the asteroid's surface. To better understand the abundances of these additional materials, we investigated visible near-infrared (0.35-2.5 μm) spectral properties of three-component laboratory mixtures of metal, low-Fe pyroxene, and carbonaceous chondrite. We compared the band depths and spectral slopes of these mixtures to the telescopic spectrum of (16) Psyche to constrain material abundances. We find that the best matching mixture to Psyche consists of 82.5% metal, 7% low-Fe pyroxene, and 10.5% carbonaceous chondrite by weight, suggesting that the asteroid is less metallic than originally estimated (∼94%). The relatively high abundance of carbonaceous chondrite material estimated from our laboratory experiments implies the delivery of this exogenic material through low velocity collisions to Psyche's surface. Assuming that Psyche's surface is representative of its bulk material content, our results suggest a porosity of 35% to match recent density estimates.",

The contrasting organic feature (graphitic and disordered) substantiates the rubble-pile asteroid model of Itokawa, and offers support for material mixing in the asteroid belt that occurred in scales from small dust infall to catastrophic impacts of large asteroidal parent bodies. Our analysis of Itokawa water indicates that the asteroid has incorporated D-poor water ice at the abundance on par with inner solar system bodies. The asteroid was metamorphosed and dehydrated on the formerly large asteroid, and was subsequently evolved via late-stage hydration, modified by D-enriched exogenous organics and water derived from a carbonaceous parent body.",

Hyperspectral data indicate that the exogenic boulders have the same distinctive pyroxene composition as the howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites that come from (4) Vesta, a 525-km-diameter asteroid that has undergone differentiation and extensive igneous processing<SUP>7-9</SUP>. Delivery scenarios include the infall of Vesta fragments directly onto Bennu or indirectly onto Bennu's parent body, where the latter's disruption created Bennu from a mixture of endogenous and exogenic debris. Our findings demonstrate that rubble-pile asteroids can preserve evidence of inter-asteroid mixing that took place at macroscopic scales well after planetesimal formation ended. Accordingly, the presence of HED-like material on the surface of Bennu provides previously unrecognized constraints on the collisional and dynamical evolution of the inner main belt.",

      "abstract": "Impact events are inevitable to date both within the inner and outer regions of the Solar System. Such impact events dominate the surface modifications of most of the airless bodies. Regardless of the destructive nature of impact events, the birth of few moons in the Solar System are known to be the by-products of impacts. Moreover, particle aggregation from relatively low velocity impacts (from nm to μm sized dust particles) are thought to be the reason behind the growth of planetesimals. While considering impact events in the colder regions of the Solar System the role of molecular ices in planetesimal aggregation cannot be neglected. Therefore, to understand the role of such small particle impacts over icy bodies, we investigated the sticking of dust particles on to ices in the higher velocity impact regime, 100-300 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, using a modified hand driven shock tube (Reddy Tube). Grains of brick, basalt and powdered turmeric, graphite and fullerene soot particles were fired on to the CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice targets. Meteorite samples (Sulagiri and Allende) were used to mimic the real micrometeorite impacts on to dry ice. The particles of different sizes and impact angle are found to significantly affect the sticking pattern. The impact area was observed to be coated by the impacting material. Lesser micron sized particles were observed to penetrate into the ice layers and the larger ones eroding them. Results suggest that astrochemical ices can be chemically enriched by high velocity dust/micrometeoroid impacts.",

      "abstract": "The primary objective of the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission is to return to Earth a pristine sample of carbonaceous material from the primitive asteroid (101955) Bennu. To support compositional mapping of Bennu as part of sample site selection and characterization, we tested 95 spectral indices on visible to near infrared laboratory reflectance data from minerals and carbonaceous meteorites. Our aim was to determine which indices reliably identify spectral features of interest. Most spectral indices had high positive detection rates when applied to spectra of pure, single-component materials. The meteorite spectra have fewer and weaker absorption features and, as a result, fewer detections with the spectral indices. Indices targeting absorptions at 0.7 and 2.7-3 μm, which are attributable to hydrated minerals, were most successful for the meteorites. Based on these results, we identified a set of 17 indices that are most likely to be useful at Bennu. These indices detect olivines, pyroxenes, carbonates, water/OH-bearing minerals, serpentines, ferric minerals, and organics. Particle size and albedo are known to affect band depth but had a negligible impact on interpretive success with spectral indices. Preliminary analysis of the disk-integrated Bennu spectrum with these indices is consistent with expectations given the observed absorption near 3 μm. Our study prioritizes spectral indices to be used for OSIRIS-REx spectral analysis and mapping and informs the reliability of all index-derived data products, including a science value map for sample site selection.",

      "abstract": "Some years ago, the consensus was that asteroid (16) Psyche was almost entirely metal. New data on density, radar properties, and spectral signatures indicate that the asteroid is something perhaps even more enigmatic: a mixed metal and silicate world. Here we combine observations of Psyche with data from meteorites and models for planetesimal formation to produce the best current hypotheses for Psyche's properties and provenance. Psyche's bulk density appears to be between 3,400 and 4,100 kg m<SUP>-3</SUP>. Psyche is thus predicted to have between ~30 and ~60 vol% metal, with the remainder likely low-iron silicate rock and not more than ~20% porosity. Though their density is similar, mesosiderites are an unlikely analog to bulk Psyche because mesosiderites have far more iron-rich silicates than Psyche appears to have. CB chondrites match both Psyche's density and spectral properties, as can some pallasites, although typical pallasitic olivine contains too much iron to be consistent with the reflectance spectra. Final answers, as well as resolution of contradictions in the data set of Psyche physical properties, for example, the thermal inertia measurements, may not be resolved until the NASA Psyche mission arrives in orbit at the asteroid. Despite the range of compositions and formation processes for Psyche allowed by the current data, the science payload of the Psyche mission (magnetometers, multispectral imagers, neutron spectrometer, and a gamma-ray spectrometer) will produce data sets that distinguish among the models.",

The measurements were conducted at the Laboratory for Spectroscopy under Planetary Environmental Conditions (LabSPEC) at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL) under vacuum and thermally-desiccated conditions (asteroid-like conditions). This is the most comprehensive 3-μm dataset of carbonaceous chondrites ever acquired in environments similar to the ones experienced by asteroids. The 3-μm reflectance spectra are extremely important for direct comparisons with and appropriate interpretations of reflectance data from ground-based telescopic and spacecraft observations of asteroids. We found good agreement between 3-μm spectral characteristics of carbonaceous chondrites and carbonaceous chondrite classifications. The 3-μm band is diverse, indicative of varying composition, thus suggesting that these carbonaceous chondrites experienced distinct parent body aqueous alteration and metamorphism environments. The spectra of CI chondrites, from which significant amount of water adsorbed under ambient conditions was removed, are consistent with Mg-serpentine and clay minerals. The high abundances of organics in CI chondrites is also associated with the mineralogy of these chondrites, oxyhydroxides- and complex clay minerals-rich. CM chondrites, which are cronstedtite-rich, have shallower 3-μm band than CI chondrites, suggesting they experienced less aqueous alteration. CR chondrites showed moderate aqueous alteration relative to CI and CM chondrites. CV chondrites, except for Efremovka, have a very shallow 3-μm band, consistent with their lower phyllosilicate proportions. CO chondrites, like most CVs, have a very shallow 3-μm band that suggest they experienced minor aqueous alteration. The 3-μm band in CH/CBb is deep and broad centered 3.11 μm, possibly due to the high abundance of FeNi metal and presence of heavily hydrated clasts in these chondrites. The 3-μm spectra of Essebi (C2-ung) and EET 83226 are more consistent with CM chondrites' spectra. The 3-μm spectra of Tagish lake (C2-ung), on the other hand, are consistent with CI chondrites. None of these spectral details could have been resolved without removing the adsorbed water before acquiring spectra.",

The identification of such a source has been lacking so far. We argue that the most probable source is one or more collisional asteroid families that have escaped discovery up to now. <BR /> Methods: We apply a novel method to search for asteroid families in the inner main-belt population of asteroids belonging to the X complex with moderate albedo. Instead of searching for asteroid clusters in orbital element space, which could be severely dispersed when older than some billions of years, our method looks for correlations between the orbital semimajor axis and the inverse size of asteroids. This correlation is the signature of members of collisional families that have drifted from a common centre under the effect of the Yarkovsky thermal effect. <BR /> Results: We identify two previously unknown families in the inner main belt among the moderate-albedo X-complex asteroids. One of them, whose lowest numbered asteroid is (161) Athor, is 3 Gyr old, whereas the second one, whose lowest numbered object is (689) Zita, could be as old as the solar system. Members of this latter family have orbital eccentricities and inclinations that spread them over the entire inner main belt, which is an indication that this family could be primordial, that is, it formed before the giant planet orbital instability. <BR /> Conclusions: The vast majority of moderate-albedo X-complex asteroids of the inner main belt are genetically related, as they can be included into a few asteroid families. Only nine X-complex asteroids with moderate albedo of the inner main belt cannot be included in asteroid families. We suggest that these bodies formed by direct accretion of the solids in the protoplanetary disc, and are thus surviving planetesimals. <P />This work is dedicated to the memory of Andrea Milani, who put the foundation and devoted his scientific career on the study of asteroid families.",

We conducted a spectroscopic survey of asteroids in the 3 μm band using the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board the Japanese infrared satellite AKARI. In the warm mission period of AKARI, 147 pointed observations were performed for 66 asteroids in the grism mode for wavelengths from 2.5 to 5 μm. According to these observations, most C-complex asteroids have clear absorption features (&gt;10% with respect to the continuum) related to hydrated minerals at a peak wavelength of approximately 2.75 μm, while S-complex asteroids have no significant features in this wavelength range. The present data are released to the public as the Asteroid Catalog using AKARI Spectroscopic Observations (AcuA-spec).",

It is considered one of the few main-belt bodies that could be an exposed proto-planetary metallic core and that would thus be related to iron meteorites. Such an association is however challenged by both its near- and mid-infrared spectral properties and the reported estimates of its density. <BR /> Aims: Here, we aim to refine the density of (16) Psyche to set further constraints on its bulk composition and determine its potential meteoritic analog. <BR /> Methods: We observed (16) Psyche with ESO VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL as part of our large program (ID 199.C-0074). We used the high angular resolution of these observations to refine Psyche's three-dimensional (3D) shape model and subsequently its density when combined with the most recent mass estimates. In addition, we searched for potential companions around the asteroid. <BR /> Results: We derived a bulk density of 3.99 ± 0.26 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> for Psyche. While such density is incompatible at the 3-sigma level with any iron meteorites (∼7.8 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), it appears fully consistent with that of stony-iron meteorites such as mesosiderites (density ∼4.25 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). In addition, we found no satellite in our images and set an upper limit on the diameter of any non-detected satellite of 1460 ± 200 m at 150 km from Psyche (0.2% × R<SUB>Hill</SUB>, the Hill radius) and 800 ± 200 m at 2000 km (3% × R<SUB>Hill</SUB>). <BR /> Conclusions: Considering that the visible and near-infrared spectral properties of mesosiderites are similar to those of Psyche, there is merit to a long-published initial hypothesis that Psyche could be a plausible candidate parent body for mesosiderites. <P />Based on observations made with 1) ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programs 086.C-0785 (PI Carry) and 199.C-0074 (PI Vernazza); and 2) the W.

It is the largest asteroid designated as M-type in the Tholen taxonomic classification and is hypothesized to be the remnant metallic core of a differentiated body, stripped of its mantle through collisions. However, it has alternatively been suggested that Psyche accreted from highly-reduced, metal-rich material near the Sun early in the formation of the Solar System. Recent infrared and visible observations have also detected spectral features indicative of low-iron pyroxenes and hydroxyl or water on its surface. We seek to better constrain the asteroid's composition through a study of its surface in the ultraviolet (UV). In April of 2017 we acquired the first UV Hubble Space Telescope observations of (16) Psyche. Using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS), we measured Psyche's reflectance spectrum at wavelengths between 160 nm - 310 nm and find that the spectrum is very red, with a reversal to a blue slope shortward of 200 nm. The spectrum is relatively featureless, with a few potentially weak absorption features in this bandpass. We will present the UV observational data, as well as our best-fit spectral models of the surface of (16) Psyche.",

      "abstract": "We analyze a comprehensive set of our adaptive optics (AO) images taken at the 10 m W. M. Keck telescope and the 8 m Gemini telescope to derive values for the size, shape, and rotational pole of asteroid (16) Psyche. Our fit of a large number of AO images, spanning 14 years and covering a range of viewing geometries, allows a well-constrained model that yields small uncertainties in all measured and derived parameters, including triaxial ellipsoid dimensions, rotational pole, volume, and density. We find a best fit set of triaxial ellipsoid diameters of (a,b,c) = (274 ± 9, 231 ± 7, 176 ± 7) km, with an average diameter of 223 ± 7 km. Continuing the literature review of Carry (2012), we find a new mass for Psyche of 2.43 ± 0.35 × 10<SUP>19</SUP> kg that, with the volume from our size, leads to a density estimate 4.16 ± 0.64 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP>. The largest contribution to the uncertainty in the density, however, still comes from the uncertainty in the mass, not our volume. Psyche's M classification, combined with its high radar albedo, suggests at least a surface metallic composition. If Psyche is composed of pure nickel-iron, the density we derive implies a macro-porosity of 47%, suggesting that it may be an exposed, disrupted, and reassembled core of a Vesta-like planetesimal. The rotational pole position (critical for planning spacecraft mission operations) that we find is consistent with others, but with a reduced uncertainty: [RA;Dec]=[32°;+5°] or Ecliptic [λ; δ]=[32<SUP>∘</SUP> ; -8<SUP>∘</SUP> ] with an uncertainty radius of 3°. Our results provide independent measurements of fundamental parameters for this M-type asteroid, and demonstrate that the parameters are well determined by all techniques, including setting the prime meridian over the longest principal axis. The 5.00 year orbital period of Psyche produces only four distinct opposition geometries, suggesting that observations before the arrival of Psyche Mission in 2030 should perhaps emphasize observations away from opposition, although the penalty then would be that the asteroid will be fainter and further than at opposition.",

      "abstract": "Water and hydroxyl, once thought to be found only in the primitive airless bodies that formed beyond roughly 2.5-3 AU, have recently been detected on the Moon and Vesta, which both have surfaces dominated by evolved, non-primitive compositions. In both these cases, the water/OH is thought to be exogenic, either brought in via impacts with comets or hydrated asteroids or created via solar wind interactions with silicates in the regolith or both. Such exogenic processes should also be occurring on other airless body surfaces. To test this hypothesis, we used the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) to measure reflectance spectra (2.0-4.1 μm) of two large near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with compositions generally interpreted as anhydrous: 433 Eros and 1036 Ganymed. OH is detected on both of these bodies in the form of absorption features near 3 μm. The spectra contain a component of thermal emission at longer wavelengths, from which we estimate thermal inertias of 167 ± 98 J m<SUP>-2</SUP>s<SUP>-1/2</SUP>K<SUP>-1</SUP> for Eros (consistent with previous estimates) and 214 ± 80 J m<SUP>-2</SUP>s<SUP>-1/2</SUP>K<SUP>-1</SUP> for Ganymed, the first reported measurement of thermal inertia for this object. These observations demonstrate that processes responsible for water/OH creation on large airless bodies also act on much smaller bodies.",

      "abstract": "Asteroid (16) Psyche, which for a long time was the largest M-type with no detection of hydration features in its spectrum, was recently discovered to have a weak 3-μm band and thus it was eventually added to the group of hydrated asteroids. Its relatively high density, in combination with the high radar albedo, led researchers to classify the asteroid as a metallic object. It is believed that it is possibly a core of a differentiated body, a remnant of `hit-and-run' collisions. The detection of hydration is, in principle, inconsistent with a pure metallic origin for this body. Here, we consider the scenario in which the hydration on its surface is exogenous and was delivered by hydrated impactors. We show that impacting asteroids that belong to families whose members have the 3-μm band can deliver hydrated material to Psyche. We developed a collisional model with which we test all dark carbonaceous asteroid families, which contain hydrated members. We find that the major source of hydrated impactors is the family of Themis, with a total implanted mass on Psyche of the order of ∼10<SUP>14</SUP> kg. However, the hydrated fraction could be only a few per cent of the implanted mass, as the water content in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, the best analogue for the Themis asteroid family, is typically a few per cent of their mass.",

They are also likely the sources of most of the water and other volatiles accreted by Earth. In this review, we discuss the nature and probable origins of asteroids and comets based on data from remote observations, in situ measurements by spacecraft, and laboratory analyses of meteorites derived from asteroids. The asteroidal parent bodies of meteorites formed ≤ 4 Ma after Solar System formation while there was still a gas disk present. It seems increasingly likely that the parent bodies of meteorites spectroscopically linked with the E-, S-, M- and V-type asteroids formed sunward of Jupiter's orbit, while those associated with C- and, possibly, D-type asteroids formed further out, beyond Jupiter but probably not beyond Saturn's orbit. Comets formed further from the Sun than any of the meteorite parent bodies, and retain much higher abundances of interstellar material. CI and CM group meteorites are probably related to the most common C-type asteroids, and based on isotopic evidence they, rather than comets, are the most likely sources of the H and N accreted by the terrestrial planets. However, comets may have been major sources of the noble gases accreted by Earth and Venus. Possible constraints that these observations can place on models of giant planet formation and migration are explored.",

Our observations show that Psyche exhibits a 3 μm absorption feature, attributed to water or hydroxyl. The 3 μm absorption feature is consistent with the hydration features found on the surfaces of water-rich asteroids, attributed to OH- and/or H<SUB>2</SUB>O-bearing phases (phyllosilicates). The detection of a 3 μm hydration absorption band on Psyche suggests that this asteroid may not be a metallic core, or it could be a metallic core that has been impacted by carbonaceous material over the past 4.5 Gyr. Our results also indicate rotational spectral variations, which we suggest reflect heterogeneity in the metal/silicate ratio on the surface of Psyche.",

This bespoke system allowed for the efficient indexing of metadata and citations, the digitization and archival of full-text articles, and the rapid development of discipline-specific capabilities running on commodity hardware. The move towards a cloud-based microservices architecture and an open-source search engine in the late 2010s marked a significant shift, bringing full-text search capabilities, a modern API, higher uptime, more reliable data retrieval, and integration of advanced visualizations and analytics. <P />Another crucial evolution came with the gradual and ongoing incorporation of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing algorithms in our data pipelines. Originally used for information extraction and classification tasks, NLP and ML techniques are now being developed to improve metadata enrichment, search, notifications, and recommendations. we describe how these computational techniques are being embedded into our software infrastructure, the challenges faced, and the benefits reaped. <P />Finally, we conclude by describing the future prospects of ADS and its ongoing expansion, discussing the challenges of managing an interdisciplinary information system in the era of AI and Open Science, where information is abundant, technology is transformative, but their trustworthiness can be elusive.",

An observatory bibliography consists of the papers published using that observatory's data, typically gathered by searching the major journals for relevant keywords. Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated has increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. The paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources, type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies.

      "abstract": "This review examines complexity science in the context of Heliophysics, describing it not as a discipline, but as a paradigm. In the context of Heliophysics, complexity science is the study of a star, interplanetary environment, magnetosphere, upper and terrestrial atmospheres, and planetary surface as interacting subsystems. Complexity science studies entities in a system (e.g., electrons in an atom, planets in a solar system, individuals in a society) and their interactions, and is the nature of what emerges from these interactions. It is a paradigm that employs systems approaches and is inherently multi- and cross-scale. Heliophysics processes span at least 15 orders of magnitude in space and another 15 in time, and its reaches go well beyond our own solar system and Earth's space environment to touch planetary, exoplanetary, and astrophysical domains. It is an uncommon domain within which to explore complexity science. After first outlining the dimensions of complexity science, the review proceeds in three epochal parts: 1) A pivotal year in the Complexity Heliophysics paradigm: 1996; 2) The transitional years that established foundations of the paradigm (1996-2010); and 3) The emergent literature largely beyond 2010. This review article excavates the lived and living history of complexity science in Heliophysics. It identifies five dimensions of complexity science, some enjoying much scholarship in Heliophysics, others that represent relative gaps in the existing research. The history reveals a grand challenge that confronts Heliophysics, as with most physical sciences, to understand the research intersection between fundamental science (e.g., complexity science) and applied science (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)). A risk science framework is suggested as a way of formulating the grand scientific and societal challenges in a way that AI/ML and complexity science converge. The intention is to provide inspiration, help researchers think more coherently about ideas of complexity science in Heliophysics, and guide future research. It will be instructive to Heliophysics researchers, but also to any reader interested in or hoping to advance the frontier of systems and complexity science.",

Traditional methods of extracting knowledge entities from texts face numerous challenging obstacles that are difficult to overcome. Consequently, there is a pressing need for improved methods to efficiently extract them. This study explores the potential of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform astronomical knowledge entity extraction (KEE) task from astrophysical journal articles using prompts. We propose a prompting strategy called Prompt-KEE, which includes five prompt elements, and design eight combination prompts based on them. We select four representative LLMs (Llama-2-70B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude 2) and attempt to extract the most typical astronomical knowledge entities, celestial object identifiers and telescope names, from astronomical journal articles using these eight combination prompts. To accommodate their token limitations, we construct two data sets: the full texts and paragraph collections of 30 articles. Leveraging the eight prompts, we test on full texts with GPT-4 and Claude 2, on paragraph collections with all LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that pre-trained LLMs show significant potential in performing KEE tasks, but their performance varies on the two data sets. Furthermore, we analyze some important factors that influence the performance of LLMs in entity extraction and provide insights for future KEE tasks in astrophysical articles using LLMs. Finally, compared to other methods of KEE, LLMs exhibit strong competitiveness in multiple aspects.",

For example, a query for \"results from the Planck mission\" should be able to distinguish between all the various meanings of Planck (person, mission, constant, institutions and more) without further clarification from the user. At ADS, we are applying modern machine learning and natural language processing techniques to our dataset of recent astronomy publications to train astroBERT, a deeply contextual language model based on research at Google. Using astroBERT, we aim to enrich the ADS dataset and improve its discoverability, and in particular we are developing our own named entity recognition tool. We present here our preliminary results and lessons learned.",

To better understand its evolution and current state, we conducted a bibliometric study using data from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and the Web of Science (WoS). In the ADS, we identified 422 peer-reviewed publications from 1980, the year of the first publication, until 2023, the cut-off year of the study. Of the 25 Colombian institutions participating in at least one publication, 14 are private and 11 are state institutions. More than half of these institutions are concentrated in two main cities: Bogotá with 11 institutions, followed by Medellín with 3 institutions. The number of contributions from four universities stands out: Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, and Universidad de Antioquia with 104, 78, 68, and 67 publications, respectively. By cross-referencing the information from the ADS and the WoS, we found that the areas in which publications with the highest impact are found are three: high energies and fundamental physics, stars and stellar physics, and galaxies and cosmology. At the global level, according to the WoS, Colombia ranks 52nd in the number of peer-reviewed publications between 2019 and 2023 and fifth in Latin America. Additionally, we identified three highly cited publications (top 1% worldwide) belonging to the field of observational cosmology.",

Furthermore, it prioritizes models with low computational requirements, making it accessible to both individuals and institutions operating on limited computing budgets. The implemented strategy only relies on a carefully crafted prompt and a grammar to guide the LLM's text completion.

The publications cover the fields of astronomy, planetary science, and heliophysics and are spread over almost 50 years, spanning the period between the year a mission was launched and the end of 2021. We study the number of papers as a function of time and the evolution of several metrics, including citations and other indices. We also investigate the geographical distribution of the authors, and for ESA Member States we correlate the various indices with the level of financial contribution of the individual countries to the ESA Science Programme. We find that in general the involvement of the scientific communities in the various Member States follows the distribution expected from the countries' gross domestic products, with communities in some field and countries, both large and small, being particularly effective at turning data into scientific discoveries. We also analyse the differences between papers written by investigators directly involved in the provision of the payloads or in the definition of the scientific projects and those written by other scientists not directly involved in the process. We find that the latter, the so-called \"archival papers\", represent more than 50\\,\\% of the literature based on data from ESA Space Science missions, and have a similar impact on the literature in the respective fields, as judged by the number of citations. This highlights the importance of sharing and preserving the scientific data produced by the missions.",

MASER solutions are based on IVOA protocols for data discovery, on IHDEA tools for data exploration, and on a dedicated format developed by MASER for the temporal-spectral annotations. The service also proposes a data repository for sharing data collections, catalogues and associated documentation, as well as supplementary materials associated to papers. Each collection is managed through a Data Management Plan, which purpose is two-fold: supporting the provider for managing the collection content; and supporting the data centre for resource management.

      "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of scientific publishing, it is important to understand the drivers of high-impact research, to equip scientists with actionable strategies to enhance the reach of their work, and to understand trends in the use of modern scientific publishing tools to inform their further development. Here, we study trends in the use of early preprint publications and revisions on ArXiv and the use of X (formerly Twitter) for promotion of such papers in computer science and physics. We find that early submissions to ArXiv and promotion on X have soared in recent years. Estimating the effect that the use of each of these modern affordances has on the number of citations of scientific publications, we find that peer-reviewed conference papers in computer science that are submitted early to ArXiv gain on average $21.1 \\pm 17.4$ more citations, revised on ArXiv gain $18.4 \\pm 17.6$ more citations, and promoted on X gain $44.4 \\pm 8$ more citations in the first 5 years from an initial publication. In contrast, journal articles in physics experience comparatively lower boosts in citation counts, with increases of $3.9 \\pm 1.1$, $4.3 \\pm 0.9$, and $6.9 \\pm 3.5$ citations respectively for the same interventions. Our results show that promoting one's work on ArXiv or X has a large impact on the number of citations, as well as the number of influential citations computed by Semantic Scholar, and thereby on the career of researchers. These effects are present also for publications in physics, but they are relatively smaller. The larger relative effect sizes, effects of promotion accumulating over time, and elevated unpredictability of the number of citations in computer science than in physics suggest a greater role of world-of-mouth spreading in computer science than in physics.",

While general LLMs like GPT-4 excel in broader question-answering scenarios due to superior reasoning capabilities, our findings suggest that continual pre-training with limited resources can still enhance model performance on specialized topics. Additionally, we present an extension of AstroLLaMA: the fine-tuning of the 7B LLaMA model on a domain-specific conversational data set, culminating in the release of the chat-enabled AstroLLaMA for community use. Comprehensive quantitative benchmarking is currently in progress and will be detailed in an upcoming full paper.

Specifically, the components of such a framework include: 1) centralization of current Python packages, 2) increasing accessibility and connectivity of these projects, 3) consideration of software attribution issues, and 4) the establishment and implementation of best practices and standards for code development. We describe the manner in which, and to what extent, PyHC has realized these four tenants. We then set forth suggestions for advancing PyHC's efforts, including ways in which we can improve our information architecture, how we can grow our community, both in terms of project sustainability and usage, as well as the social component of the community itself, how we can improve PyHC package integration, and finally, non-Python library considerations. The suggested improvements and additions therein advance PyHC's mission and strategic goals, while helping better integrate PyHC into the broader Heliophysics and Space Weather community efforts.",

      "abstract": "The automatic identification of planetary feature names in astronomy publications presents numerous challenges. These features include craters, defined as roughly circular depressions resulting from impact or volcanic activity; dorsas, which are elongate raised structures or wrinkle ridges; and lacus, small irregular patches of dark, smooth material on the Moon, referred to as \"lake\" (Planetary Names Working Group, n.d.). Many feature names overlap with places or people's names that they are named after, for example, Syria, Tempe, Einstein, and Sagan, to name a few (U.S. Geological Survey, n.d.). Some feature names have been used in many contexts, for instance, Apollo, which can refer to mission, program, sample, astronaut, seismic, seismometers, core, era, data, collection, instrument, and station, in addition to the crater on the Moon. Some feature names can appear in the text as adjectives, like the lunar craters Black, Green, and White. Some feature names in other contexts serve as directions, like craters West and South on the Moon. Additionally, some features share identical names across different celestial bodies, requiring disambiguation, such as the Adams crater, which exists on both the Moon and Mars. We present a multi-step pipeline combining rule-based filtering, statistical relevance analysis, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER) model, hybrid keyword harvesting, knowledge graph (KG) matching, and inference with a locally installed large language model (LLM) to reliably identify planetary names despite these challenges. When evaluated on a dataset of astronomy papers from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), this methodology achieves an F1-score over 0.97 in disambiguating planetary feature names.",

At NASA SciX we have developed an experiment where we created semantic vectors for our large collection of abstracts and full-text content, and we designed a prompt system to ask questions using contextual chunks from our system. Based on a non-systematic human evaluation, the experiment shows a lower degree of hallucination and better responses when using Retrieval Augmented Generation.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroLLaMA, a 7-billion-parameter model fine-tuned from LLaMA-2 using over 300,000 astronomy abstracts from arXiv. Optimized for traditional causal language modeling, AstroLLaMA achieves a 30% lower perplexity than Llama-2, showing marked domain adaptation. Our model generates more insightful and scientifically relevant text completions and embedding extraction than state-of-the-arts foundation models despite having significantly fewer parameters. AstroLLaMA serves as a robust, domain-specific model with broad fine-tuning potential. Its public release aims to spur astronomy-focused research, including automatic paper summarization and conversational agent development.",

Here, we describe PACMan2, an updated tool for proposal review management that utilizes machine-learning models and techniques to topically categorize proposals and reviewers, to match proposals to reviewers, and to facilitate proposal assignments, mitigating some conflicts of interest.

This preliminary work highlighted a significant absence of local institutional involvement in international publications. In light of this, a follow-up study was conducted to confirm or refute these first impressions, by comparing the search in two bibliographic databases: Web of Science and Scopus. The results show that almost 60% of the publications based directly on data from the Puna, the Altiplano, or the Atacama Desert with objectives related to planetary science or astrobiology do not include any local institutional partner (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru). Indeed, and beyond the ethical questioning of international collaborations, Latin-American planetary science deserves a strategic structuring, networking, as well as a road map at national and continental scales, not only to enhance research, development, and innovation, but also to protect an exceptional natural heritage sampling extreme environmental niches on Earth. Examples of successful international collaborations such as the field of meteorites, terrestrial analogs, and space exploration in Chile or astrobiology in Mexico are given as illustrations and possible directions to follow to develop planetary science in South America. To promote appropriate scientific practices involving local researchers, possible responses at academic and institutional levels will eventually be discussed.",

Other ongoing machine learning efforts at ADS that build upon these tools include leveraging well defined taxonomies, such as the Unified Astrophysical Thesaurus and the USGS/IAU Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, to enhance the search and discovery of astrophysical concepts and planetary features. These new tools, and more that will build upon them, will both provide a richer user experience and allow internal processes to be scaled-up. One mode of disseminating these tools to the public was through the first Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications, held in November 2022. Along with submitted papers and talks, several teams competed to build their own Named Entity Recognition systems to compare against astroBERT.

When evaluated on two hidden test sets provided by the organizer, our best-performing submission achieved $F_1$ scores of 0.8307 (validation phase) and 0.7990 (testing phase).",

Yet the challenges confronting Earth and Space Science are increasingly complex, requiring wider collaboration and data integration. We offer a framework to address the challenge of knowledge integration that precludes transdisciplinary progress: a knowledge commons [McGranaghan et al., 2021].We will detail three projects working in parallel to build the knowledge commons:Enriching Heliophysics data in the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS): Create a set of concepts and their semantic representation that improves the discovery of Heliophysics literature by NASA ADS;The Heliophysics KNOWledge Network (Helio-KNOW): collection of software and systems for improved information representation in Heliophysics, focusing on the magnetosphere-ionosphere system; andThe NASA Center for HelioAnalytics: a cross-community effort focused on improving knowledge and application of data science to Heliophysics.This talk will provide a clear discussion of what knowledge representation is and its importance for all scientific domains and collaborations. It will make that discussion actionable by relating it to three active projects. Finally, it will reveal how the community can participate-outlining the commons component.McGranaghan, R., Klein, S.

Moreover, this analysis shows that 90% of all high-impact papers in astronomy are led by authors based in North America and Europe. That is, only about 10% of countries in the world host astronomers that publish \"astronomy's greatest hits\".",

We have now remedied this shortcoming by using the OpenAPI specification, a language-agnostic, widely adopted industry standard for documenting APIs in a machine-readable way. This OpenAPI document underlies our new beautiful, easy to use documentation, powered by RapiDoc. In addition to providing a listing of all available API endpoints, the new documentation defines all available inputs and possible API responses, offers examples, and provides further description and explanation as necessary. The most unique feature of the new documentation is the built-in try-me functionality, which allows you to run API queries directly from your browser.

This work was started as a result of the Asclepias project, funded through a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to the American Astronomical Society. The main goal of the Asclepias project is to promote scientific software into an identifiable, citable, and preservable object. It highlighted the fact that no single stakeholder can solve the software citation problem. It requires close collaboration between a publisher (the American Astronomical Society), a repository (Zenodo) and an indexing service (ADS). This paper focuses on the contribution the ADS has made to this project. Five years later, the ADS has indexed just over 10k Zenodo software records, representing almost 19k citations. How did we get here? We describe the underlying infrastructure developed at ADS which implements a software citation detection, metadata capture and ingest, and event-driven notification system to a broker used by ADS collaborators. We include a discussion of the challenges that we have encountered in the implementation and operation of the system.",

In this ocean of data, the NASA ADS allows users to quickly string match words and sentences against the indexed full-text content but this does not solve the word sense disambiguation problem (e.g., \"Planck\" can refer to the person, the mission, the constant or several institutions). The NASA ADS is preparing a dataset of manually tagged entities which is being used to train Deep Learning models to automatically recognize and disambiguate facilities.

We discuss the various types of science programs and science categories that were used to collect data during the mission and discuss how operational changes brought on by the depletion of cryogen in 2009 May, including the resulting budget cuts, impacted the publication rate. The post-cryogenic (warm) mission produced fewer papers than the cryogenic mission, but the percentage of the exposure time published did not appreciably change between the warm and cryogenic missions. This was mostly because in the warm mission the length of observations increased, so that each warm paper on average uses more data than the cryogenic papers. We also discuss the speed of publication, archival usage, and the tremendous efficacy of the Legacy and Exploration Science programs (large, coherent investigations), including the value of having well-advertised enhanced data products hosted in centralized archives. We also identify the observations that have been published the largest number of times, and sort them by a variety of metrics (including program type, instrument used, and observation length). Data that have the highest reuse rates in publications were taken early in the Spitzer mission, or belong to one of the large surveys (large either in number of objects, in number of hours observed, or in area covered on the sky). We also assess how often authors have cited the Spitzer fundamental papers or have correctly referenced the Spitzer data they used, finding that as many as 40% of papers have failed to cite the papers, and 15% have made it impossible to identify the data they used.",

They contain references to other papers, data products, people, institutions, and funding sources, among others (Accomazzi, 2015). Since the whole of the products referenced by a scholarly article forms the best representation of the science discussed in the article, having a proper coverage of these sources will help in properly representing different aspects and stages of research life cycles. Just capturing citations to other scholarly publications would not only leave out important information, it would also omit proper attribution to researchers who contribute as authors of non-traditional research products. The ADS has implemented a workflow for capturing software citations, the concept of which was presented at LISA VIII (Muench, Accomazzi, &amp; Holm Nielsen, 2017); this workflow allows the detection and ingest of citations to software products used in scholarly publications (Henneken, Muench, Holm Nielsen, Blanco-Cuaresma, &amp; Accomazzi, 2019). Since both data and software citations are crucial for the transparency of research results and for the transmission of credit (van de Sandt et al., 2019), the ADS will implement indexing of high-level data products, in particular those published by NASA Archives, and track their citations. We will conclude by speculating how additional text mining and curation efforts can be used to further link the literature to additional resources mentioned in the papers.",

Instead, software citation behaviors developed independently from standard publication mechanisms and policies, resulting in human-readable software citations that cannot effectively represent the influence software has had in the field. These historical software citation behaviors need to be understood in order to improve software citation guidance and develop relevant publishing practices that fully support the astronomy community. To this end, a twenty-three year retrospective analysis of software citation practices in astronomy was developed. Astronomy publications were mined for 410 aliases associated with nine software packages and analyzed to identify practices and trends that negatively impact software citation implementation.",

Thus, the objective of this work is to analyze the contribution of the Open Access (OA) modality to the impact of hybrid journals. For this, the research articles in the year 2017 from 200 hybrid journals in four subject areas, and the citations received by such articles in the period 2017-2020 in the Scopus database, were analyzed. The journals were randomly selected from those with share of OA papers higher than some minimal value. More than 60 thousand research articles were analyzed in the sample, of which 24% under the OA modality. As results, we obtain that cites per article in both hybrid modalities strongly correlate. However, there is no correlation between the OA prevalence and cites per article in any of the hybrid modalities. There is OA citation advantage in 80% of hybrid journals. Moreover, the OA citation advantage is consistent across fields and held in time. We obtain an OA citation advantage of 50% in average, and higher than 37% in half of the hybrid journals. Finally, the OA citation advantage is higher in Humanities than in Science and Social Science.",

Yet most software authors do not specify how they would like their code to be cited, while others specify a citation method that is not easily tracked (or tracked at all) by most indexers. Two metadata file formats, codemeta.json and CITATION.cff, developed in 2016 and 2017 respectively, are useful for specifying how software should be cited. In 2020, the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, ascl.net) undertook a year-long effort to generate and send these software metadata files, specific to each computational method, to code authors for editing and inclusion on their code sites. We wanted to answer the question, \"Would sending these files to software authors increase adoption of one, the other, or both of these metadata files?\" The answer in this case was no. Furthermore, only 41% of the 135 code sites examined for use of these files had citation information in any form available. The lack of such information creates an obstacle for article authors to provide credit to software creators, thus hindering citation of and recognition for computational contributions to research and the scientists who develop and maintain software.",

A sister instrument, JUICE-UVS, has already launched and successfully completed commissioning this year, which has enabled some early preparation for expected data acquisition, sensitivity, and data pipeline structure for the instrument on board Europa Clipper. Europa-UVS observes photons in the 55-205 nm wavelength range through a 7.5° x 0.1° plus 0.2° x 0.2° shaped slit. Through a variety of observational techniques including stellar occultations, disk scans, Jupiter transit observations, and neutral cloud/plasma torus stares, the Europa-UVS investigation is poised to perform a comprehensive study of Europa's surface, atmosphere, and local space environment. The spatial distribution of the planned observations over the duration of the mission will enable searches for, and the characterization of, any current activity such as plumes on Europa. The science goals of Europa-UVS are to: 1) Search for and characterize any current activity, notably plumes or thermal anomalies, in regions that are globally distributed; and 2) Characterize the composition and sources of volatiles, particulates, and plasma, sufficient to identify the signatures of non-ice materials, especially organic compounds, in globally distributed regions of the atmosphere and local space environment. We present an overview of the planned observational techniques for the Europa-UVS investigation, how they will accomplish the stated science goals, and how they contribute to the primary objective of the Europa Clipper mission to assess the habitability of Europa.",

The observations were designed to assess the presence of hydration on Psyche's surface and to distinguish between any indications of hydration resulting from either hydroxyl or water molecules. Our program obtained high SNR (~200), high spectral resolution (~0.003 µm), near to mid-IR spectra (0.97 – 6.73 µm) of Psyche to detect the entire 3-µm and 6-µm absorption and emission bands attributed to hydroxyl and/or water. JWST's unique capability to measure the entire 3 and 6-µm bands enables us to constrain Psyche's surface composition and impact history, providing critical context for the upcoming 'Psyche' mission and interpretations of hydration features observed on asteroids. We observed Psyche with a total of two visits using the NIRSpec Integral Field Unit and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instruments. The NIRSpec observations were separated by ~1/2 of Psyche's rotation period, and the MIRI observations were separated by 5 days with a ~70% offset in rotation period. Psyche was nearly pole-on during these observations, and therefore the two visits associated with each instrument are not anticipated to reveal significantly different portions of the asteroid's surface. However, we were able to resolve Psyche across ~10 pixels in diameter, enabling identification of compositional variability across a single hemisphere within each observation. We will present on the current state of our ongoing analysis of potential 3 and 6-µm features observed along with their variation across Psyche's surface, and speculate on the implications for Psyche's composition, origin and evolution, and the broader context of these findings as they relate to M-type asteroids and the evolution of the solar system.",

Hypotheses related to the distribution of hydration in the solar system can be tested by observing compositionally similar asteroids in different regions of the asteroid belt. A widely used method for determining hydration on asteroids is through the detection of an absorption band near 3 micron caused by the O-H fundamental stretching mode. The band center and shape of the 3 micron feature has implications for the type and abundance of asteroidal hydration. There is no way to distinguish the cause of the 3 micron feature (H2O, aqueously altered minerals, or a combination of both) without spectra at complementary wavelengths. The MIR spectral region offers an opportunity to disentangle the effects of H2O and aqueously altered minerals on asteroid surfaces. Molecular H2O and aqueously altered minerals have distinct spectral features across the MIR bandpass. The goal of this program is to use MIRI MRS and NIRSpec IFU to distinguish between water ice, aqueously altered minerals, or a combination of both as the compositional component(s) responsible for the 3 micron absorption. We will observe two asteroids that are representatives of two major groupings of asteroids defined by their 3 micron band shapes: (142) Polana and (225) Henrietta. We will compare the spectra from both intruments from labratory spectra of relevant minerals to constrain the compositions of both asteroids and determine the level of aqueous alteration on both.",

      "abstract": "Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), seasonally varying dark streaks on Mars' surface of unknown origin remain some of the most poorly understood features on Mars. These features have been considered the best evidence for liquid water flow on the surface of Mars, but a competing hypothesis for the origin of these enigmatic features does not require water and instead forms them via wind-cached grainflows. This hypothesis suggests that seasonal changes in winds act to cache lofted sand in locations where: (1) upslope saltation (grain transport) is impeded by large topographic rises (outcropping bedrock), or (2) downslope saltation is minimized due to wind shadowing outcropping bedrock. This cache then accumulates until slope failure. The released sand due to slope failure would then produce a dark streak as it displaces dust on the surface thereby producing an RSL without requiring liquid water. Confirming or refuting whether dry grainflows can produce these features has important implications for our understanding of water on Mars. Small aeolian features are below the resolution of available observations, so supporting evidence for this hypothesis requires simulating the conditions that would yield these features and comparing these simulated grainflows to RSL observations. Grainflow simulations can be produced via discrete element method modeling using the open-source software LIGGGHTS. This software is capable of simulating millions of particles with tunable properties (including particle size distribution and material) while under the influence of tunable external forces. We present results from our investigation of the hypothesized dry grainflow mechanism for RSL formation through parametric studies carried out using LIGGGHTS to identify grainflow conditions that would produce observed RSL flow rates and extents measured from HiRISE observations of Rauna crater.",

These products include light curves and optical depth profiles as functions of ring radius. In addition to providing key parameters of interest obtained through each of these occultations, we show that the optical depths of various ring regions derived from solar occultations are consistent with those from stellar occultations. We also demonstrate that fits to self-gravity wake parameters are similar for solar and stellar occultations.

      "abstract": "Uranus is surrounded by a complex ring system that includes a variety of tenuous structures composed primarily of dust-sized particles. These dusty rings were first seen in images obtained by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, but several of them were thought to only be detectable in a single Voyager image. It has therefore been difficult to compare these data to other observations of these rings and other dust populations. In particular, ground-based images obtained at near-infrared wavelengths in 2007 indicated that the location of the peak brightness of the innermost dusty ring (known as the zeta ring) had likely shifted outwards from where it was in one Voyager 2 image (de Pater et al. 2007 Science), but it was not clear whether this shift is associated with a change in the overall brightness of this ring. New investigations of the Voyager data have now revealed that the zeta ring is visible in many more clear-filter low-resolution Voyager images, spanning a relatively broad range of observing and lighting conditions. These data not only confirm that the location of the peak brightness in the zeta ring did indeed change between 1986 and 2007, but also indicate that the total amount of material in this ring also changed substantially over that time. Furthermore, these data allow the distribution of dust around Uranus to be more directly compared with the dust populations around the other giant planets, facilitating investigations of transport processes like atmospheric drag that should operate in all these different systems.",

The most recent observations of these planets were made during the Voyager 2 flybys in 1986 and 1989 for Uranus and Neptune respectively. This brief glimpse of Uranus and Neptune over 30 years ago revealed enigmatic worlds that demand missions singly devoted to unraveling their mysteries. Uranus in particular, with its exotic magnetic field, strangely hot stratosphere, anomalously low heat flux, and puzzling interior, serves as an extreme environment in which we can test hypotheses for the way our Solar System formed and evolved. The inclusion of a Uranus orbiter as the third highest priority Flagship mission in the NASA Planetary Science Decadal Survey Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 20132022 indicates a high level of support for exploration of the ice giants by the planetary science community. However, given the substantial costs associated with a flagship mission, it is critical to explore lower cost options if we intend to visit Uranus within an ideal launch window of 20292034 when a Jupiter gravity assist becomes available. We present the Quest to Uranus to Explore Solar System Theories (QUEST), a New Frontiers class Uranus orbiter mission concept study performed at the 30th Annual NASA/JPL Planetary Science Summer Seminar. The proposed QUEST platform is a spin-stabilized spacecraft designed to undergo highly elliptical, polar orbits around Uranus during a notional one-year primary science mission. The proposed major science goals of the mission are (1) to use Uranus as a natural laboratory to better understand the dynamos that drive magnetospheres in the solar system and beyond and (2) to identify the energy transport mechanisms in Uranus' magnetic, atmospheric, and interior environments in contrast with the other giant planets. With substantial mass, power, and cost margins, this mission concept demonstrates a compelling, feasible option for a New Frontiers Uranus orbiter mission.",

M-type asteroids in particular potentially represent the exposed cores of differentiated planetesimals, but there is insufficient data to claim with certainty that these asteroids are purely metallic. Previous detections of hydration and phyllosilicates on their surfaces further complicate the assumed composition of these asteroids. We propose to observe (16) Psyche, the prototypical M-type asteroid and target of the upcoming NASA Discovery mission 'Psyche', to quantify the amount and variability of hydration present on (16) Psyche's surface and to unambiguously determine if the hydration is a result of hydroxyl or water molecules. Our program will obtain high SNR, high spectral resolution, near to mid-IR spectra of (16) Psyche to detect and contemporaneously observe the entire 3-micron and 6-micron absorption and emission bands attributed to hydroxyl and/or water, potentially uniquely identifying water for the first time. We propose to observe (16) Psyche with a total of two visits using the NIRSpec Integral Field Unit and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instruments to obtain spectra from two, distinct hemispherical regions and thereby measure any global variability of the hydration features. JWST's unique capability to measure the entire 3 and 6-micron bands on the largest M-type asteroid will unambiguously identify the presence of water or hydroxyl on (16) Psyche, constraining (16) Psyche's surface composition and impact history, providing critical context for the upcoming 'Psyche' mission and interpretations of hydration features observed on asteroids.",

The key parameters that produce these events need to be characterized to understand the mechanical behavior of granular media, which is composed of the surfaces of small bodies. We carried out flight and ground-based research campaigns designed to investigate these mass transfer events. The goals of our experimental campaigns were (1) to identify projectile energy thresholds that influence mass transfer outcomes in low-energy collision events between cm-size projectiles and μm-size regolith, (2) to determine whether these mass transfer events required a microgravity environment to be observed, and (3) to determine whether the rebound portion of these collision events could be replicated in a laboratory drop tower environment. We found that (1) mass transfer events occurred for projectile rebound accelerations &lt;7.8 m/s2 and we were unable to identify a corresponding impact velocity threshold, (2) mass transfer events require a microgravity environment, and (3) ourdrop tower experiments were able to produce mass transfer events.

Particles in this size regime also compose a layer of regolith on small, airless bodies that evolves under conditions very different than those on Earth. Characterizing the response of regolith to low-energy impacts in a microgravity environment is therefore critical to our understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of these objects and our ability to develop safe operation procedures on their surfaces. Flight-based microgravity experiments investigating low-velocity collisions of cm-size projectiles into regolith have revealed that certain impact events result in mass transfer from the target regolith onto the surface of the projectile. Characterizing the key parameters and their interactions that produce these events have important implications for the role of energy dissipation and accretion in planet formation processes and understanding the mechanical behavior of granular media composing the surfaces of small bodies. I carried out experimental and numerical campaigns designed to investigate these mass transfer events and found that accretion outcomes differ significantly depending on whether the projectile is launched into granular material or initially at rest before pulling away from the granular bed. I found that interaction effects between various parameters and the balance of the experiment design significantly influence mass transfer outcomes and must be taken into account for future experiment designs. I also present my contributions to a CubeSat mission that will provide the opportunity to observe tens of thousands of collisions between particles in the velocity and size regime relevant to the earliest stages of planet formation.",

The long duration, high-quality microgravity environment provided by a CubeSat is the perfect platform to study the collisional evolution of particles in the size regime relevant to the first stages of planet formation. Q-PACE is a 3U CubeSat mission designed to produce tens of thousands of low-velocity (mm/s - cm/s) collisions between micron to cm-size particles. The large number of collisions will make it possible to provide a probabilistic description of collisional outcomes that can be used in planet formation models. The experiment consists of particles contained within a backlit experimental test chamber (ETC) within the CubeSat, a shaking mechanism to control the particle ensemble velocity distribution, a chamber to introduce new particles at different experiment phases, and an overhead camera to record collisions within the chamber. Experiments will be carried out in four phases: (1) collisions between 5 1-cm and 30 2-mm particles in the ETC; (2) addition of 30 mm-size chondrules to the ETC; (3) addition of 100-micron SiO<SUB>2</SUB> dust aggregates to the ETC; and (4) vigorous shaking of the ETC to disaggregate the dust aggregates and observe dust-coated particle interactions. To reproduce the anticipated results of these experiments we carried out simulations using the DEM granular mechanics software LIGGGHTS. The tunable parameters of our simulation include the particle number density and size distribution selected to reflect discrete experimental phases, the particle velocity distribution, and the cohesive properties of the particles. Through our simulations we identify formation timescales for clusters of varying sizes as well as the frequency of accretion, bouncing, and fragmentation events as a function of the tunable parameters. We present the results of our numerical simulations as well as the implications for interpreting future data produced by the Q-PACE mission.",

      "abstract": "Small particles (μm to cm-size) in planetary ring systems and protoplanetary disks collide at low velocities (less than 1 m/s) and tend to aggregate through non-gravitational interactions. Additionally, exploration and sample return missions to asteroids and other small, airless bodies involve low energy interactions with weakly-bound regolith particles. Therefore, to characterize the processes that lead to planetesimal formation and planetary ring collisional evolution, and to develop appropriate procedures for asteroid sample return missions, it is necessary to understand how regolith responds to low-energy collisions in a microgravity environment. The COLLIDE (Collisions Into Dust Experiment) and PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) programs produced observations of mass transfer of regolith onto cm-scale projectiles at impact velocities &lt; 40 cm/s in microgravity conditions. These experiments were carried out on orbit (COLLIDE, COLLIDE-2), in suborbital space (COLLIDE-3), and on parabolic airplane flights (PRIME) under vacuum. To study this phenomenon with significantly reduced cost and time constraints we have developed an experimental apparatus that makes use of a laboratory drop tower (free-fall time 0.75 s). The experiment consists of a tube pumped to vacuum conditions containing a cm-diameter marble suspended from a spring in contact with a bed of regolith. The spring contracts during free-fall allowing us to simulate the rebound portion of a low-velocity collision in a laboratory microgravity environment. We are also carrying out concurrent numerical simulations with the use of a discrete element method particle simulation program, LIGGGHTS (Kloss et al. 2012, Prog. Comp. Fluid Dyn., 12, 140), to replicate these environmental conditions and study the role of cohesion in mass transfer events. We will present the results of our laboratory and numerical studies where we vary rebound velocity, target material type and grain size distribution, projectile size and material, and regolith packing density designed to bolster our understanding of collisional evolution in the protoplanetary disk and planetary rings.",

The COLLIDE (Collisions Into Dust Experiment) and PRIME (Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment) programs created impacts into simulated planetary regolith with cm-scale impactors to observe ejecta production and coefficients of restitution in microgravity. These experiments were carried out on orbit (COLLIDE, COLLIDE-2), in suborbital space (COLLIDE-3), and on parabolic airplane flights (PRIME) under vacuum. Some impacts at speeds less than 40 cm/s resulted in mass transfer from the target regolith onto the impactor. To study these mass-transfer collisions in more detail without the cost or time requirements of spaceflight or parabolic flights, we developed an experimental apparatus in a laboratory drop tower (free-fall time 0.75 s) and performed experiments at standard pressure. The impactor is suspended from a spring and remains in contact with the bed of regolith until free-fall allows the spring to retract and pull the impactor upwards. This method allowed us to simulate the rebound portion of a low-velocity collision in a laboratory microgravity environment. We achieved rebound velocities of 10 - 60 cm/s, and we observed mass transfer events with rebound speeds below 40 cm/s. The amount of mass transfer produced was more significant than a monolayer of granular material, but less than the amount observed in the COLLIDE and PRIME experiments. These mass-transfer collisions may play a role in the growth of planetesimals. We will present the results of our laboratory-based studies where we vary impact velocity and target material, and discuss implications for collisional evolution in the protoplanetary disk and planetary rings.",

      "abstract": "The regolith covering the surfaces of asteroids and planetary satellites is very different from terrestrial soil particles and subject to environmental conditions very different from what is found on Earth. The loose, unconsolidated granular material has angular-shaped grains and a broad size distribution. On small and airless bodies (&lt;10 km), the solar wind leads to a depletion of fine grains (&lt;100µm) on the surface. Ground observations of the two asteroids currently targeted by spacecraft, Ryugu (Hayabusa-2) and Bennu (OSIRIS-REx), indicate that their surfaces could be covered in mm- to cm-sized regolith grains. As these small bodies have surface gravity levels below 10<SUP>-5</SUP>g, g being the Earth surface gravity, the cohesion behavior of the regolith grains will dictate the asteroid’s surface morphology and its response to impact or spacecraft contact.Previous laboratory experiments on low-velocity impacts into regolith simulant with grain sizes &lt;250 µm have revealed a transition of the grain behavior from a gravity-dominated regime to a cohesion-dominated regime when the local gravity level reaches values below 10<SUP>-3</SUP>g. This is in good agreement with analytical and simulation studies for these grain sizes. From the expected grain sizes at the surfaces of Ryugu and Bennu, we have now focused on larger grain sizes ranging from mm to cm. We have carried out a series of experiments to study the cohesion behavior of such larger grains of asteroid regolith simulant. The simulant used was CI Orgueil of Deep Space Industries. Experiments included laboratory tabletop avalanching, compression and shear force measurements, as well as low-velocity impacts under microgravity.Our goal is to determine if the grain size distribution has an influence on the cohesion behavior of the regolith and if we can validate numerical simulation results with experimental measurements. We will discuss the implications of our results for sample return or landing missions to small bodies such as asteroids or Martian moons.",

      "abstract": "The study of low velocity collisions (&lt;1 m/s) is essential to understand the growth and formation of aggregates in a number of environments in planetary systems. The Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) and Physics of Regolith Impacts in Microgravity Experiment (PRIME) experiments produced observations of mass transfer from regolith onto an impactor at these velocities in microgravity. We have subsequently carried out ground-based experiments in which a cm-scale sphere impacts and rebounds from a bed of granular material in 1-g laboratory conditions at low impact speeds with the aid of a spring. This allows impacts at v&lt;1 m/s and ensures rebound of the impactor, with the spring providing enough force to overcome gravity. Preliminary results from an impact of a brass impactor into sand (200-500 μm) produced a monolayer of granular material onto the impactor, but the grains are not cohesive enough to allow a significant mass transfer under these conditions. Further experiments with a range of regolith properties, impactor composition and surface properties, impact velocities, and atmospheric conditions will be performed in the laboratory to study the effects of each of these properties on the contact transfer of regolith onto the impactor. Further microgravity experiments with PRIME and in a small drop tower are planned to then study bulk mass transfer with conditions informed by the ground-based experiments. Impacts with the COLLIDE and PRIME microgravity experiments showed mass transfer at speeds &lt; 40 cm/s into JSC-1 lunar regolith simulant and quartz sand targets. We will present the free-fall and laboratory results and implications for the collisional evolution of dust, pebbles and boulders in the protoplanetary disk as well as particles in planetary ring systems.",

Here we provide a high-level, cross-instrument, and cross-discipline overview of the geologic investigations planned within the Europa Clipper mission. Europa's fascinating collection of ice-focused geology provides an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the dynamics of icy shells, ice-ocean exchange processes, and global-scale tectonic and tidal stresses. We present an overview of what is currently known about the geology of Europa, from global to local scales, highlighting outstanding issues and open questions, and detailing how the Europa Clipper mission will address them. We describe the mission's strategy for searching for and characterizing current activity in the form of possible active plumes, thermal anomalies, evidence for surface changes, and extremely fresh surface exposures. The complementary and synergistic nature of the data sets from the various instruments and their integration will be key to significantly advancing our understanding of Europa's geology.",

      "abstract": "Observations of Jupiter's largest moon Ganymede by Voyager and Galileo revealed fractures and evidence of strike-slip faulting, leading to studies for the mechanisms of these structures focused on extensional tectonism and gravitational tidal stresses. In this analysis, we investigate the geologic history of Ganymede in the area of Nippur/Philus Sulci (175°E, 36.9°N) by examining Galileo high-resolution data available for this region (∼100 m/pixel) and conducting a tidal stress investigation of Ganymede's past. Several crosscutting bands of light terrain in the Nippur/Philus Sulci site show varying degrees of tectonic deformation, ranging from smooth and less distorted bands to highly grooved and deformed terrain. The chronology of tectonic activity implied by mapped crosscutting relationships reveals three eras of distinct geologic activity: 1. Ancient, 2. Intermediate and 3. Youngest. Indicators of shear deformation are found throughout all ages of terrain, but mapped early-stage indicators of strike-slip features are exclusively located in intermediate and youngest terrain. An investigated offset feature in intermediate-aged terrain corresponds in slip direction to the predictions from modeling stresses of a higher past eccentricity. However, the en echelon structures found in a younger geologic unit do not align in slip direction with typical first-order R Riedel shears. This suggests that these features might have formed through another process and the observed en echelon folds could be passive structures, which can be created through relatively rapid large displacement on a fault. Through modeling of Ganymede's past tidal stresses, we can conclude that a past higher eccentricity (e &gt; 0.02) could have distorted the Nippur/Philus Sulci region in its second, intermediate phase of main deformation, yielding a stress field conducive to shear failure of the icy upper crust. New data from NASA's Juno mission, as well as future observations by ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission and NASA's Europa Clipper mission, will further aid our understanding of the tectonic history of Ganymede and improve the resolution of tectonic feature analysis.",

Putative Europa plumes observed by the Hubble Space Telescope [1] should be observed in situ in the coming decade by several NASA/ESA missions, including Europa Clipper [2], Juno [3], and Juice [4]. Like for the plumes observed on Enceladus, the Europan plumes are supposed to be composed of water vapor and water ice grains, plus other volatiles [5-7]. The two-phase water vapor/ice grain plumes of those airless icy outer solar system moons, which vent up to hundreds of km above the surface, are a key signature of what lies below the surface. Such plumes would form a canopy with most of the material falling back onto the planet's surface [8]. Similar to what was done for the Enceladus plumes [9-11], we simulate the Europan plumes using the DSMC PLANET code [12] to determine their spatially- and temporally-resolved steady-state behavior. For each plume, we consider an axisymmetric circular vent with a vertical domain extending up to 400 km, where a canopy is formed. We consider conditions at the vent to be similar to those found for the case of Enceladus: a mass flow rate of 10.4 kg/s, a vent radius of 10.2 m, an exit speed of the gas and the grains of 902 m/s, a mass fraction between the two phases equal to 5%, and a mixture exit temperature of 53 K. Then we simulate the full 3D plume, including the non-symmetrical external forces (Jovian gravity, centrifugal acceleration due to Europa's orbiting Jupiter, and Coriolis acceleration). We compare the results to the 2D axisymmetric case, for different latitudes and longitudes of the plume's vent. We also include other species in the outgassed mixture (such as methane). Finally, we account for the interaction. between the Jovian plasma environment and the plume, focusing on the impact on the plume number density and velocity fields.

      "abstract": "The influence of the Jovian space environment on the Galilean moons is multifaceted, and observations of moon-magnetosphere interaction by the Europa Clipper will provide an understanding of the satellites' interior structure and compositional makeup among others. The variability of Jupiter's magnetic field at Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto induces electric currents within the moons' conducting ocean layer, the magnitude of which depends on the ocean's location, extent, and conductivity. The Galilean moons are also embedded in a flow of corotating plasma and energetic particles, which continuously impacts and sputters the surfaces to produce the moons' atmosphere. In addition, micrometeorite impacts eject particles of the surface to wrap the moons in clouds of dust. The neutral atmospheres are readily ionized by energetic particles to produce an ionosphere, which gives rise to current systems electromagnetically connecting the moons to their host planet. The Europa Clipper mission will observe the causes and effects of Europa's interaction with its space environment using a suite of in-situ and remote-sensing instruments. The Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM) will measure magnetic fields generated by currents induced in Europa's subsurface ocean and the electromagnetic coupling of the moon to Jupiter. The Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS) will measure ions and electrons in Europa's ionosphere to infer plasma currents and coupling between Europa and Jupiter. The MAss Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (MASPEX) measures trace neutral species to determine the composition of Europa's atmosphere. The SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA) will map the chemical composition of particles ejected from Europa's surface and identify the makeup of potential plumes by directly sampling microscopic particles. The spacecraft's Radiation Monitor will provide engineering-grade spectral and total dose measurements of the energetic particles comprising the Jovian radiation environment. Finally, remote sensing instruments will enable studies of how these particles change the composition and microstructure of the surface. Observations made by Europa Clipper during 49 Europa flybys, combined with complementary data acquired by the JUICE spacecraft is expected to provide a comprehensive picture of the interaction of the Galilean moons with Jupiter's magnetosphere. We present the highlights of the moon-magnetosphere interaction science we seek to unravel with the Europa Clipper mission and the primary investigations involved in these studies.",

      "abstract": "Europa's surface is one of the youngest in the solar system. The Jovian moon is believed to hide a global liquid water ocean under its icy crust [1] and is exposed to intense space weathering due to the continuous bombardment by electrons and ions from Jupiter's magnetosphere [2]. To understand the processes governing the evolution of the surface it is necessary to finely characterize the microphysics of the ice (composition via endmember volume abundance, grain size and surface roughness). However, the majority of the previous studies [3,4] do not allow to constrain precisely these parameters. Here we report the use of a radiative transfer model [5] in a Bayesian MCMC inference framework [6,7] to retrieve microphysical properties of Europa's surface using the Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) hyperspectral data [8]. We present the analysis of a calibrated spectrum of a dark lineament from the trailing Anti-jovian hemisphere. The estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is between 5 and 50, we mainly focus on the 1.0-2.5 µm region for which the SNR is higher [8]. A first work has allowed us to test all combinations of 3, 4 and 5 endmembers from a list of 15 relevant compounds [9]. We were able to test over 5,000 combinations and show that some compounds appear necessary to reproduce the observation, such as water ice and sulfuric acid octahydrate, in agreement with previous studies [3,4,10]. However, adding either hydrated sulfates or chlorine salts produces results substantially similar [9]. Here we present a follow-up study in which we focus on the few acceptable combinations identified by our Bayesian inversions and we analyze the results in terms of grain size and surface roughness. We show that the grain size of the mandatory endmembers is well constrained and similar from one combination to another [11]. The macroscopic roughness is however poorly constrained [11], as expected. Thanks to numerical optimizations we are able to invert independently every spectel of a NIMS hyperspectral cube with the bayesian MCMC algorithm. From this result, we present maps of microphysical properties on an entire hyperspectral image of a dark lineament. References: [1] Pappalardo, R. et al. (1999) JGR. [2] Carlson, R. W. et al.

      "abstract": "The NASA Galileo spacecraft explored the Jupiter system between 1995 and 2003. The mission was equipped with the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer instrument (NIMS), able to probe the Jupiter's atmosphere and the icy moons' surface composition in the near-infrared with its 17 detectors operating between 0.7 to 5.2 microns [1]. Depending on the instrument mode used to collect data, and on the instrument own health status, infrared spectra were collected with a varying spectral sampling (between 15 and 408 wavelengths), and absolute wavelength calibration over the course of the mission. Data were collected during flybys, which resulted in diverse data cubes viewing geometries and spatial resolutions. Despite its heterogeneity and complexity of use, the Galileo/NIMS data set represents, to date, one of the most valuable data set for modeling and mapping the surface composition of Jupiter's moons, which are the prime targets of the Europa Clipper [2] and ESA JUICE [3] missions in this decade. We are currently re-investigating the spectroscopic and photometric properties of the Jovian moons using the Galileo/NIMS data set publicly available on the PDS Imaging Node (g-cubes) and decomposed into a MySQL relational database. Radiance factors (I/F) spectral data can be retrieved from the database using queries on metadata, such as the viewing geometry (incidence, emission, phase, and azimuth), and the location (pixel geographic latitudes and longitudes, spatial resolution, target), integrated over the entire NIMS data set in a matter of seconds. This allows the rapid extraction of phase curves and spectra as prime inputs to spectrophotometric data modeling studies [4, 5, 6]. We will present examples of applications of such framework to the study of Jupiter's icy moons surface properties. References [1] Carlson et al., Space Science Reviews, 60, 457-502, 1992.

      "abstract": "Background: On Europa, mass wasting deposits show similar behaviors to those observed across the solar system, on bodies such as Vesta, Ceres, Iapetus, Moon, and Mars [1-6]. Based on the emplacement morphology, we categorize Europan mass-wasting features into slides (47 total), slumps (2 total), and flow-like features (5 total). Overall, slides are the most commonly observed mass-wasting feature, and the majority (n=31) of them are clustered within the Conamara region, likely due to the distribution of Galileo high-resolution data. Fig. 1a shows the example of a sliding feature where we observe the downward motion of the deposit, exposing bedrock chutes at the crest and partially buried rocks within the deposit region (red arrows in Fig. 1a, resolution: 9 m/pixel). Typically, these types of features are common in the case of granular flows where granular particles experience mobility and follow the slope until the angle of repose is achieved [7]. Heim's ratio: In general, the mobility of mass wasting deposits is measured by estimating the friction coefficient ratio (µ) also known as Heim's ratio [8]. Here, the drop height-to-runout length ratio, H/L, is commonly used as a proxy for friction coefficient. On Earth and Mars, there is a trend for decreasing H/L with increasing deposit L (Fig. 1b). Likewise, slides on Europa follow this trend but do not show a strong correlation (slope is -0.40±0.3). The values scatter between 0.1- 0.6, and for similar H/L a range of deposit L is observed. Overall, the friction between Europan particles is inferred to be somewhat similar to Earth and Mars, but their mobility is relatively restricted. The lack of dependence of H/L on L could be controlled by surface slope, regolith volume, and/or rheological mechanism [1-6].",

Europa's interior, surface, atmosphere, and near-space environment will be examined to understand the moon's ice shell, ocean, composition, geology, and to search for any current activity, including possible plumes. The mission's science objectives will be accomplished with a complementary suite of instruments: Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS), Europa Imaging System (EIS), Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE), Europa Thermal Imaging System (E-THEMIS), Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON), Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM), Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA), and MAss Spectrometer for Planetary EXploration (MASPEX). Gravity and Radio Science (G/RS) will be achieved using the telecommunication system, and Radiation Monitoring (RADMON) data will be collected by engineering sensors. The mission is currently in assembly, test, and launch operations (ATLO) phase. As of this writing (July 2023), all of the science instruments have been successfully delivered and most are installed on the spacecraft (live at <A href=\"https://bit.ly/clippercam\">https://bit.ly/clippercam</A>). The flight system will be shipped to Kennedy Space Center in May 2024, where the solar arrays and REASON antennas will be integrated for final pre-launch testing.

      "abstract": "The surface of Europa shows a variety of morphological features, often unique among the known icy bodies. Scarcity of impact craters indicates a very young surface (≤ 90 Myr), most likely a consequence of recent, or even active, tectonic processes driven by a combination of tidal deformation, internal dynamics and orbital interactions. Modeling work has found that an extension of the ice shell can trigger material transport from the subsurface ocean to the surface, in accordance with the morphology of numerous extensional bands [1]. While harder to identify, compressional features have also been detected. The reconstruction of geologic features revealed that almost a 100-km-wide region was missing, possibly sank by subduction [2,3,4]. If it occurred, subduction would have profound consequences for Europa's habitability. It is, however, not clear what is the mechanism driving the compression. Processes such as global melting, polar wander, or nonsynchronous rotation could account for sufficient compressive stress, but in the absence of self-sustaining plate tectonics, the extent of the deformation is limited to only a few kilometers. Numerical models assuming a half-subducted salt-rich porous plate concluded that it is rather unlikely to maintain such a process in the long term [5,6]. Here we address this issue by modeling compression of initially undamaged shell composed of pure ice. Using a 2D finite element model with visco-elasto-plastic rheology, free surface, and phase transition at the ice-water interface, we show that convergence can result either in subduction or in building positive topography. The scenario depends mainly on the shell thickness and the heat transfer regime, suggesting that the convergent events on Europa might have occurred during the period of high orbital eccentricity, when the ice shell was thin and conductive [7].

In some cases, topographic lows between subparallel ridges are sites of smooth material displaying few craters. We consider whether such smooth material can be generated by mass wasting triggered from local seismic shaking. We hypothesize that debris would flow from topographic highs into lows, initially mobilized by moonquake-induced seismic shaking during formation of local tectonic ridges, covering and infilling older terrain. We analyze the feasibility of seismicity to trigger mass movements by measuring fault scarp dimensions to estimate quake moment magnitudes. The inferred magnitude range is 4.0-7.9, and we use numerical modeling to estimate seismic accelerations resulting from such quakes. This modeled magnitude range implies seismic accelerations that can exceed satellite gravitational accelerations, particularly near quake epicenters. Thus, seismic events could feasibly cause mass wasting of material to form some fine-scale smooth surfaces observed on at least three icy satellites: Ganymede, Europa, and Enceladus.",

      "abstract": "Europa may host a water ocean. This moon, as well as Ganymede and Callisto will be explored by the ESÁs JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in April 2023. JUICE has scheduled several flybys to these three moons although will end up making a longer stay orbiting around Ganymede. One major goal of the mission is to evaluate the habitability potential of the interior environments of the moons. Europa singles out by having its ocean in direct contact with the silicate rock mantle. Water-rock interactions might provide energy and bio-essential elements CHONPS, supporting a favourable environment for life. Environmental conditions are constrained in time by the biogeochemical cycles, in which minerals play an important role in the retention and release of molecules containing these elements. One approach to understand that issue is to characterise the mechanisms that would drive material transfer processes between the ocean and the surface. Among the resurfaced areas in Europa are chaos terrains. Chaos terrains represent areas where the preexisting surface was disrupted in blocks and a matrix filled the gap between the displaced blocks [1, 2, 3]. Furthermore, it is shown coloured red-brown at visible wavelength due to the presence of endogenous non water-ice minerals such as sulphates, sulphuric acid hydrates, sodium chloride and/or Na-carbonates [4, 5, 6]. Therefore, chaos would likely be involved in material exchange processes upward. However, to date there is not a consensus model in order to explain the triggering mechanism in the formation of this feature. In this work we mapped chaos terrains using Galileo SSI images. We categorized them into four facies typologies based on the degreeof disruption- melting. Theobjectiveis toseek geomorphological patterns relatedtochanges in the crustal behaviour within chaos terrains in order to evidence the mechanism responsible for their formation and the possible role of crustal compositional heterogeneities in this mechanism.

At the beginning of the next decade, the spacecraft will orbit Jupiter, flying by Europa more than 40 times over a four-year period to observe this moon's ice shell and ocean, study its composition, investigate its geology, and search for and characterize any current activity. The mission's science objectives will be accomplished using a highly capable suite of remote-sensing and in-situ instruments. The remote sensing payload consists of the Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS), the Europa Imaging System (EIS), the Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE), the Europa Thermal Imaging System (E-THEMIS), and the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON). The in-situ instruments comprise the Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM), the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA), and the MAss Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (MASPEX). Gravity and radio science will be achieved using the spacecraft's telecommunication system, and valuable scientific data will be acquired by the spacecraft's radiation monitoring system. The project, flight system, and payload have completed their Critical Design Reviews, and the project has completed its System Integration Review, so that Europa Clipper is now formally in mission Phase D. The spacecraft and payload are currently under construction, as assembly, testing, and launch operations (ATLO) are well underway. Recent major milestones include the delivery to ATLO of the Propulsion Module and six instruments (E-THEMIS, Europa-UVS, EIS-WAC, PIMS, MASPEX, SUDA) and the assembly of the solar array wings. The integration of these instruments' sensors on the spacecraft and its nadir-viewing deck and of the instrument electronics in vault has begun. The remaining instruments (ECM, EIS-NAC, MISE, REASON) are in mature stages of assembly and will be delivered in the next months.

In the DSMC method particular gas flows are calculated through the collision mechanics of representative atoms or molecules that are subject to binary collisions to simulate macroscopic gas dynamics.NASA's Europa Clipper mission [2] and ESA's JUpiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) [3] will encounter Europa with flybys in the 2030s to sample the atmosphere of the icy moon using mass spectroscopy. Measurements with the MAss Spectrometer for Planetary EXploration (MASPEX) onboard Europa Clipper and the Neutral gas and Ion Mass spectrometer (NIM) onboard JUICE will determine the composition of Europa's exosphere and, potentially, sample the plume material. From the exosphere measurements, the chemical composition of Europa's surface could be derived, whereas plume measurements would potentially allow conclusions about the chemical conditions of Europa's subsurface ocean.Models of the collision-less exosphere for the icy moon [4, 5] have shown that Europa's ice-sputtered atmosphere is dominated by O2 near the surface with an extended H2 corona at higher altitudes. Here, we compare the results of these studies with the DSMC model including deeper layers of Europa's collisional atmosphere.[1] Bird, G. A. (1994).

      "abstract": "Intense tectonism is evident on many outer solar system satellites with some surface regions exhibiting ridge-and-trough structures which have characteristics suggestive of normal faulting. In some cases, topographic lows between subparallel ridges are sites of smooth material displaying few craters. We consider whether such smooth material can be generated by mass wasting triggered from local seismic shaking. We hypothesize that debris would flow from topographic highs into lows, initially mobilized by moonquake-induced seismic shaking during formation of local tectonic ridges, covering and infilling older terrain. We analyze the feasibility of seismicity to trigger mass movements by measuring fault scarp dimensions to estimate quake moment magnitudes. Seismic moment (Mo) is defined as the energy release caused by a fault rupture and subsequent quake, and moment magnitude (Mw) is a logarithmic scaling of Mo, a function of shear modulus µ (here adopted as 3.5 GPa for ice), Ab, the area of the rupture block face in m2, and p, the resulting scarp slip in m. Given that p is currently unknown for icy satellites, we consider a range of assumed values in our calculations. The resulting magnitude range is 5.3-8.6, and we use numerical modeling to estimate seismic accelerations resulting from such quakes.Magnitude ranges are used to model resulting seismic accelerations. Interior models to create the synthetic seismograms were generated using Planetprofile, based on current constraints of spacecraft data. Synthetic seismograms were then reconstructed for arbitrarily placed receivers and a seismic source within the generated satellite interior models. The seismic source strength is set to be within our calculated magnitude range.We adopt surface gravitational acceleration as the criterion which, if exceeded, implies that coseismic mass wasting is expected. Modeled seismic accelerations can exceed satellite gravitational accelerations, particularly near quake epicenters. Thus, seismic events could feasibly cause mass wasting of material to form some fine-scale smooth surfaces observed on at least three icy satellites: Ganymede, Europa, and Enceladus.Currently, existing image resolution, areal extent, and stereo coverage are severely constrained. A better understanding of tectonic and coseismic mass wasting processes will be possible when the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions provide high-resolution surface imaging, including stereo imaging, along with subsurface radar sounding, for both Europa and Ganymede.",

The long-term spin state of the ice shell is controlled by the time-mean torques acting upon it. A torque that has not been previously considered is exerted due to drag from oceanic currents beneath the ice. We estimate this torque for the first time by performing global, nonhydrostatic, three-dimensional simulations of Europa's ocean, including nonlinear turbulent boundary layer drag at the seafloor and ice-ocean interface. Our simulations show that ocean dynamics, which manifest in alternating east-west jets, result in a net torque on the ice shell. The torque can act to either spin up or spin down the ice shell depending on the strength of convection, suggesting that a torque reversal can occur as Europa's interior thermally evolves. Scaling analysis indicates that an average jet speed of at least ∼1 cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> is required for the ice-ocean torque to be comparable to the tidal torque acting to spin up the ice shell. Our results suggest that ocean currents may contribute to any nonsynchronous rotation of the ice shell. Consequently, Europa's present-day spin state may hold information about the dynamics of its subsurface ocean.",

      "abstract": "To assess the potential habitability of Jupiter's moon Europa, it is important to understand its chemical composition (Hand et al., 2007). Young terrain features on Europa's surface likely consist of material up-welled from the liquid water source below (Wilson et al., 1997; Pappalardo et al., 1998; McCord et al., 1999; Figueredo and Greeley, 2004; Mével and Mercier, 2007), encoding relevant compositional information. A major science objective of NASA's Europa Clipper mission is to characterize the composition of young terrain features using data acquired on close flybys. The Surface Dust Analyzer (SUDA) is an in situ instrument that collects and analyzes the composition of individual grains (Kempf et al., 2012), which are ejected from Europa's surface by a continuous bombardment of interplanetary impactors (Krüger et al., 1999, 2003; Goode et al., 2021). By applying a dynamical model of these particles, we compute the probability of SUDA's detections originating from a given feature along the flyby trajectory based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra that characterize the chemical composition of individual grains, results in a time series of various compositional types along the flyby. We present here a method to analyze a time series of compositional spectra recorded by SUDA that provides a robust estimate for the abundance of compositional types on the surface, spatially resolved for features along the ground track of the flyby. By demonstrating the association of compositional detections with geological sites of origin, data collected by SUDA can be used to infer the compositional ground truth for terrain features on Europa.",

      "abstract": "Introduction <P />The reliable identification of biosignatures on extraterrestrial ocean worlds is key to the search for life in our Solar System. Saturn's moon Enceladus, and potentially Jupiter's moon Europa, emit plumes of gas and ice grains formed from subsurface water into space (e.g. Spahn et al. 2006, Roth et al. 2014). The compositions of individual ice grains in such a plume can be analyzed during spacecraft flybys by impact ionization mass spectrometers, such as the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA; Srama et al. 2004) on board the past Cassini mission, the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA; Kempf et al. 2014) on board the upcoming Europa Clipper mission (Howell &amp; Pappalardo 2020), or the ENceladus Ice Analyzer (ENIA), proposed for future Enceladus missions (Reh et al. 2016). <P />Analysis of CDA mass spectra collected in the Saturnian System revealed that Enceladus's ocean is salty (Postberg et al. 2009) and contains a variety of organic material, including complex macromolecules (Postberg et al. 2018) as well as low-mass volatile compounds (Khawaja et al. 2019). Our recent detection of phosphates in ice grains emitted by Enceladus (Postberg et al. 2022, under review) further enhances Enceladus's potential as a habitable environment, possibly able to support microbial life in its subsurface ocean. <P />Impact ionization detectors, such as SUDA or ENIA, are the only instruments capable of determining the compositions of single µm- or sub-µm-sized ice grains emitted by ocean world plumes. Cassini CDA results showed that refractory organics occur in only a few percent of plume ice grains and are believed to form from an organic film covering the oceanic surface (Postberg et al., 2018). If cell material is indeed present, it would likely reside in even fewer ice grains, potentially as many as just one in a thousand. <P />On Earth, 70% of the planetary surface is covered by a biofilm, the surface microlayer on top of the ocean water (Flemming and Wuertz, 2019), which hosts a distinct microbial community at cell densities 3 – 5 orders of magnitude higher than in the bulk water phase (Franklin et al. 2005). After lifting, organics and cells from this surface layer can initiate ice crystal formation in clouds (Pratt et al. 2009). <P />Methods and Results <P />To simulate a scenario, in which biosignatures are present only in a small fraction of emitted grains, but with relatively high cell densities, we conducted laboratory analogue experiments with Sphingopyxis alaskensis, an ultrasmall (volume of &lt;0.1 µm3) bacterium, extracted from various cold marine environments (Ting et al. 2010). We simulated the case of an individual ice grain of 15 µm in diameter - constituting an extremely low cell density case for Enceladus where ice grains are generally much smaller (1-5 µm in diameter) - formed from a nucleation core of a single inactivated bacterial cell. <P />We used Laser Induced Liquid Beam Ion Desorption (LILBID) – a proven technique to accurately simulate impact ionization mass spectra of ice grains recorded byin space (Klenner et al. 2019, 2020, 2020a). Recent LILBID experiments demonstrated that trace amounts of DNA and lipids extracted from bacterial cultures will produce characteristic signals in the mass spectra of ice grains emitted from ocean worlds (Dannenmann et al. 2022, under review). Here we present the next steps – LILBID experiments with untreated lysed bacterial cells, simulating the appearance of these microbial life forms in impact ionization mass spectra of single 15 µm ice grains. <P />In both polarity mass spectra, we clearly identify signatures of S. alaskensis. Cationic mass spectra exhibit features due to protonated amino acids, either fragments of the bacteria's proteins or metabolic intermediates. Sequences of deprotonated fatty acids, fragments of bacterial lipids, are identifiable in anionic mass spectra. Our experiments show that even if less than 0.1% of the constituents of a single cell would form a nucleation core of a 15µm ice grain, the bacterial signature would be apparent in the data. The signal-to-noise ratio would be even higher in smaller ice grains. <P />Conclusions <P />Our results show that biosignatures deriving from a single bacterial cell – or small fractions thereof - embedded as a nucleation core in a single µm ice grain will be clearly identifiable in impact ionization mass spectra from SUDA-type instruments. This demonstrates the advantage of analyzing individual ice grains in a plume over analyzing the average composition of all plume material encountered during a flyby. A modern impact ionization instrument like SUDA or ENIA would be capable of recording 10,000 – 100,000 ice grain spectra (cationic and anionic) during a single plume passage, allowing the detection of biosignatures present in only 1 out of 100,000 grains during a multiple flyby mission. Such low abundances would be out of reach for other analytical methods that measure the integrated - and thus extremely diluted - concentrations of such biosignatures in a plume.

      "abstract": "Ocean worlds possess fascinating and mysterious subsurface environments shaped by a variety of processes, including tides. Most models of the tidal response of Europa, a key measurement of the Europa Clipper mission, assume an ocean of constant density. Yet, the density structure of Europa's ocean is unknown. We simulate how density stratification alters Europa's tidal response to eccentricity-forcing using a three-dimensional general circulation model. In particular, we determine how different oceanic density gradients permit and affect the generation of internal tides, and the corresponding displacement of the ocean surface. We find that, in general, a more steeply stratified ocean supports larger internal tides, with particular density gradients producing a resonant internal tide response. If the internal tide response is resonant, Europa's tidal deformation magnitude can be altered by a few meters. The tidal phase lag also increases, causing the ocean's effective tidal quality factor, $Q$, to vary by several orders of magnitude.",

      "abstract": "The mechanisms for chaos terrain formation on Europa have long been a source of debate in the scientific community. There exist numerous theoretical and numerical models for chaos formation, but to date there has been a lack of quantifiable observations that can be used to constrain models and permit comparison to the outputs of these chaos models. Here, we use mapping and statistical analysis to develop a quantitative description of chaos terrain and their observed morphologies. To gain greater insight into how chaos is formed, we are specifically interested in comparing the chaos morphologies quantitatively through block size distributions. From our regional mapping, it is apparent that there are distinct differences in the abundance, size, and distribution of elements making up different chaos terrains. We map nine individual areas of chaos, focusing on blocks—outcrops of pre-existing terrain—down to ~1 km size. We demonstrate that chaos terrains follow a continuous spectrum of morphologies between two endmembers, platy and knobby. We find that any given chaos terrain's morphology can be quantified by means of the linearized exponential slope of its cumulative block area distribution, or size-frequency distribution (SFD). This quantitative metric provides a new diagnostic parameter in future studies of chaos terrain formation and comparison. We are currently investigating potential further correlations between the SFDs and other values—such as geographical location, and chaos size—which may reveal further information on differences between chaos terrains. Additionally, we are analyzing trends among chaos block orientations, chaos terrain border orientation, and nearby linear features to investigate further potential controls (e.g., pre-existing tectonic fabrics) on chaos formation.",

      "abstract": "Europa's surface hosts many features proposed to originate from brine sources within its icy crust (Fagents, 2003). An intriguing possible example is the asterisk-shaped `spider' at the center of Manannán crater (Figure 1, a), identified by the Galileo mission (Moore et al., 2001). The feature was proposed to consist of a network of fractures, and Steinbrugge et al., 2021 suggest formation by impact-induced cryovolcanic plume activity. The proposed fracturing was described as analogous to the plume activity hypothesized to form araneiforms or 'spider' features on Mars. However, Martian spiders are not ice fractures; they are negative topography troughs that are likely eroded into loose regolith via the solid-state greenhouse effect (Kieffer et al., 2006). Moreover, due to limited spatial resolution of the Galileo Solid State Imager in this area (20-100 m/pixel), topographic data from DTMs cannot ascertain whether the feature does consist of fractures. Instead, we propose a gradient-driven growth process to form the dendritic, `finger-like' pattern seen in Manannán crater, that on Earth forms 'lake stars' (Figure 1, b) (Tsai &amp; Wettlauer, 2007). Lake stars are striking patterns that develop on the surface of ice-covered lakes in winter when the lake surface freezes and snowfall covers the thin ice. Either due to the weight of the snow, or a protrusion such as a stick, the ice cracks and water wells through the snow or slush (Knight, 1987). As it melts the snow, this relatively warm water creates dark regions in the ice. Locations with faster flow rates melt preferentially, leading to an instability that results in `fingers' (Tsai &amp; Wettlauer, 2007). Eventually the system freezes, preserving this `star-like' pattern encased within the ice. We suggest that Manannán's spider may originate from a similar process under a post-impact transient atmosphere, where its `arms' are not fractures but instead are low-albedo ice surrounded by frozen impact slurry. We describe laboratory experiments to investigate the formation of this pattern in Europa granular ice simulant under post-impact temperature regimes (Figure 1, c), and we present initial calculations to describe the hypothesized process for Europa.",

Young terrain features on Europa's surface likely consist of material up-welled from the liquid water source below (Wilson et al., 1997; Pappalardo et al., 1998; McCord et al., 1999; Figueredo and Greeley, 2004; Mével and Mercier, 2007), encoding relevant compositional information. A major science objective of NASA's Europa Clipper mission is to characterize the composition of young terrain features using data acquired on close flybys. The Surface Dust Analyzer (SUDA) is an in situ instrument that collects and analyzes the composition of individual grains (Kempf et al., 2012), which are ejected from Europa's surface by a continuous bombardment of interplanetary impactors (Krüger et al., 1999, 2003; Goode et al., 2021). By applying a dynamical model to these particles, we compute the probability of SUDA's detections originating from a given feature along the flyby trajectory based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra that characterizes the chemical composition of individual grains results in a time series of various compositional types along the flyby. We present here a method to analyze a time series of compositional spectra recorded by SUDA that provides a robust estimate for the abundance of different compositional types on the surface, resolved for features along the ground track of the flyby. By demonstrating the association of compositional detections with geological sites of origin, data collected by SUDA is used to infer the compositional ground truth for young terrain features on Europa.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Ganymede, Jupiter's largest moon, is thought to have a salty subsurface ocean underlying an ice shell and may harbor the conditions to support life. The uppermost crust is mainly comprised of two types of terrain: heavily cratered, dark terrains and bright terrains often characterized by grooves [1]. The surface has also been subject to various landform degradation processes, such as mass movement, volatile segregation and migration, impact erosion, and regolith generation [2]. For example, such processes could be responsible for the formation of the dark deposits (layers) observed on Galileo Regio that vary in thickness (and other properties) as a function of their resting slope and position relative to local topographic crests, among other criteria [2]. Landform degradation processes thus can spatially alter the near-surface structure, characterized by different densities, impurities, and thicknesses (from tens to hundreds of meters). We present a radiometric approach for investigating the properties of near-surface layering at Ganymede from the combined observations of radar sounding systems that will reach the Jovian system within the next decade. Multi-frequency Radar Sounders. The JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) from the European Space Agency (ESA) will be orbiting Ganymede by 2034. Its science payload includes the Radar for Icy Moons Exploration (RIME), a 9-MHz central frequency radar sounder with a 1-MHz (low resolution) or 3-MHz (high resolution) bandwidth (noted [9/1 MHz] and [9/3 MHz], respectively) [3]. Nearly concurrently, the Europa Clipper from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), will perform flybys of Ganymede once to thrice, providing complementary observations from the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON), a dual frequency radar sounder at [60/10 MHz] and [9/1 MHz] [4]. This wealth of multi-frequency and multi-bandwidth observations is uniquely suited to constraining Ganymede's near-surface properties through differential surface reflectometry. Reflectometry of Layered Near-surfaces. Reflectometry is related to the measurement of the radar surface echo strength that is sensitive to surface and near-surface properties with a footprint-size spatial resolution of several kilometers (depending on the spacecraft altitude) [5]. The near-surface depth is bounded by the vertical resolution defined from the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. In void, [60/10 MHz], [9/1 MHz] and [9/3 MHz] radar systems have a vertical resolution of 15 m, 50 m and 150 m, respectively [4]. The reflection strength of a homogeneous icy near-surface combined with a smooth surface is nearly independent of the radar system across the RIME-REASON frequency range. However, a sharp dielectric gradient from a horizontal discontinuity in the near-surface affects the effective surface reflection coefficient (Re) because of the phase shift between the surface and the near-surface reflections that are coherently integrated when measured at the receiver. Thin-film theory provides analytical tools to predict Re for layered media as a function of the layers' thickness and permittivity, as well as the signal wavelength [6].As an illustration, consider an overburden layer of unknown thickness (zlayer) and permittivity (εlayer), bounded by a void (ε0 = 1), and covering a compact ice substrate (εice = 3.1). Fig. 1 illustrates the field of solutions for Re computed for the three radar systems considered and assuming a synthetic chirp of 100 μs. Each plot on Fig. 1 is characterized by two regimes. When zlayer is larger than the near-surface depth, then the signal strength is independent of zlayer across all frequencies and only dependent on εlayer. Note in particular that as zlayer gets thinner than the near-surface depth, Re exhibits a resonant behavior strongly dependent on zlayer relative to the radio wavelength. Hence, multi-frequency observations can be overlapped, although the solutions are not necessarily unique. However, additional constraints like assumed lateral continuity of the near-surface structure can help resolve most ambiguities.In addition, surface roughness has a wavelength-dependent effect on surface reflectivity that can be difficult to deconvolve from the effect of near-surface layering. In that regard, because the [9/1 MHz] and [9/3 MHz] radar systems provide the same response to roughness (same radio wavelength), their response should differ only when layer boundaries are between their respective near-surface depths (different bandwidth).A strategy based on the combination of the reflectivity plots in Fig. 1 for the range of frequencies/bandwidths deployed on Ganymede can then be used to constrain its near-surface properties. An analog application on a terrestrial ice cap is provided in the next section. Proof-of-concept: Devon Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic. The near-surface of Devon Ice Cap (DIC) is subject to melting and refreezing processes, forming meters-thick ice layers embedded in lower porosity firn. The reflections from these layers from the surface down to the near-surface depth affect the coherent power (Pc) observed by a radar sounder (IPR). Fig. 2 illustrates a transect over DIC, where concurrent ground-penetrating radar (GPR) collected at 500 MHz and airborne IPR observations collected at [60/15 MHz] exist. Superimposed on the GPR radargram is a pink line that represents the frequency/bandwidth-constrained near-surface depth/vertical resolution of the airborne IPR. Results indicate that the behavior of Pc (green line) well correlates with the ice layer thickness within the near-surface depth and decorrelates below the near-surface depth at this frequency.

      "abstract": "1. IntroductionLiquid water reservoirs in Europa's icy crust, if they exist, could represent the most accessible liquid water bodies in the outer solar system. Previous studies have demonstrated that freezing cryoreservoirs might trigger eruptions due to the pressurization associated with volume change as liquid water expands to become water ice [1, 2]. Locating potentially stored and erupted brines is key for the exploration of ocean worlds and the search for habitability and life beyond Earth.Here, we aim to numerically model the coupled chemical evolution and pressurization of freezing brines stored in Europa's ice shell using current best estimates of the oceanic composition [3] to predict the composition of erupted cryolava. This composition varies with time, as salts concentrate during freezing [4], which could lead to erupted brines of varying composition depending on the reservoir frozen fraction when the eruption is triggered. This could explain the variations of albedo observed around features potentially associated with cryovolcanism, for example smooth plains, as shown in Fig. 1.Figure 1: Smooth plain on Europa's surface with morphology consistent with eruption of liquid cryolava [1]. The yellow and orange arrow indicate two areas of different albedo, which may have been emplaced by two eruptive events of brines of different composition. NASA Galileo image 9352r.2. MethodsCryomagma chemistry Whether they are formed by in-situ melting [5] or intrusion of oceanic water [6], the best estimate for cryomagmatic fluid composition is provided by models of evolution of Europa's interior and ocean. An example cryomagma composition used in our model, consistent with oceanic compositions predicted by recent literature [3], in wt.%, is 99.0% H2O, 0.32% Na, 0.28% Cl, 0.16% bicarbonate, 0.21% sulfate, 0.027% K, 0.013% Ca, and 0.002% Mg. The equilibrium freezing of oceanic brines is modeled using the software PHREEQC [7] to obtain the liquid and solid fraction of each component of the aqueous solution as a function of the temperature. We use these data as an input of the model presented below.Model principle Previous studies [1, 2] demonstrated that internal overpressure increases in potential freezing cryoreservoirs as cryomagma transitions to the less-dense solid phase. The critical freezing time required to break the reservoir and trigger an eruption is a function of the reservoir chemical and physical parameters (see example in Fig. 2 for a spherical 500 m radius reservoir located 2 km below the surface and filled with pure liquid water [1, 2]). The cryomagma chemical evolution during freezing will affect the solution and formed ice densities, and can thus make the critical freezing time different from what was calculated by previous studies. We thus need to model the cryomagma composition and internal overpressure as coupled variables. By doing so, we will be able to predict a realistic critical freezing time to trigger eruptions, as well as the cryomagma composition when the eruption begins.Figure 2: Pressure as a function of the time in a 500 m radius freezing cryoreservoir located 2 km below the surface. Here the cryomagma is composed of pure water only [2].Numerical procedure We couple temperature-dependent compositional outputs from PHREEQC with a 1D numerical simulation using the finite differences method to simulate a freezing cryoreservoir. At each time step (i.e., reservoir temperature), we vary the composition of the formed ice and remaining aqueous solution. We modify several parameters accordingly, such as the liquid and solid densities and thermal conductivities. We ensure the energy and mass are conserved through time by calculating the cryomagma frozen fraction that balances the heat lost during each time step. As an output of the model, we can obtain the temporal evolution of: (i) the temperature in the reservoir, (ii) the composition of the formed solid and the remaining liquid and (iii) the internal overpressure. Finally, we can predict the composition of the erupted brines once (and if) the eruption is triggered.Cyclic eruptions After the first eruption, cryomagma reservoirs may keep freezing and trigger several other eruptions as evoked in Lesage et al. [8]. We added the possibility to continue freezing and trigger several eruptions to our numerical simulation so that we can observe the evolution of erupted brines composition through time.3. Preliminary resultsInitial results demonstrate that salts concentrate in the reservoir during freezing, which decreases the solution freezing temperature and can make the freezing slower than expected with simpler models [1, 2]. On the other hand, the ice formed is initially mostly composed of pure liquid water and thus has a low density compared to the remaining liquid, which can accelerate the pressurization. The effect of both these mechanisms on the critical freezing time have to be quantified. The concentration of non-water components through time is also expected to result in cryolava flows with darker albedo and varying spectral signatures in the case of repeated eruptive events. These results will inform the upcoming missions JUICE (ESA) [9] and Europa Clipper (NASA) [10] on the spectral signatures that could indicate the presence of shallow sub-surface cryoreservoirs and provide information on their activity.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The Galilean satellites' surfaces and subsurfaces will be explored by robotic spacecraft in the early 2030s, but significant advances from ground-based astronomical facilities will be possible in the coming decade. Ganymede's surface is composed of regions of brighter young terrain with similar composition to Europa's young surface, and older dark terrain that has a higher abundance of potentially silicate-rich material (Pappalardo et al., 2004). Infrared spectra from the Galileo orbiter Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) provided high-spatial-resolution IR spectra of Ganymede but with limited spatial coverage in many locations. In recent years, ground-based adaptive optics observations in the infrared with Keck/OSIRIS (Brown &amp; Hand, 2013) and VLT/SINFONI (Ligier et al., 2019), along with orbital visible wavelength observations using HST (Trumbo et al. 2021) have provided new insights into the distributions of surface materials on the Galilean satellites. Datasets: Near-IR observations with almost complete longitudinal coverage of Ganymede were taken with the ground-based VLT/SPHERE in 2015 and 2021, producing spectral cubes covering 0.95 to 1.65 μm (at R∼30) and dual band images at 2.11 and 2.25 μm. SPHERE has a high spatial resolution, with a pixel size of 7.46 mas/px, corresponding to ∼25 km/px at Jupiter. Accounting for diffraction, this allows features ∼150 km across to be easily resolved. Galileo/NIMS observations with similar spatial coverage have also been analysed to provide a direct comparison to the SPHERE dataset.Visible wavelength observations of Ganymede with VLT/MUSE were acquired in 2019, covering the trailing and anti-jovian hemispheres. MUSE produces high spectral resolution spectra from 480 nm (R=1740) to 930 nm (R=3450). MUSE has a spatial sampling of 25 mas/px and a spatial resolution of ~80mas, corresponding to ~275 km on Ganymede's surface. Figure 1: VLT/SPHERE dual band images of Ganymede (top) compared to simulated visible light images using the USGS reference basemap (bottom). The two colour images show the 2.11 µm filter in orange and the 2.251 µm filter in blue. Water ice has a broad absorption around 2 µm, so blue areas are icy and orange areas are contaminated. (King &amp; Fletcher, in review) MCMC spectral modelling: We analyse the mapped near-IR cubes from VLT/SPHERE by fitting to laboratory spectra from reference cryogenic libraries, including water ice, sulphuric acid, hydrated salts, and spectrally flat 'synthetic' spectra. Our fitting routine uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to model observed spectra, producing a posterior distribution of fitted abundance values for each endmember at each observed location (King et al., 2022). These posterior distributions can be sampled to calculate the best estimate abundance and its associated uncertainty for each endmember and class of endmembers, allowing more detailed investigation of the confidence of different detections. Results: Spectral modelling results of the VLT/SPHERE observations confirm previous results, showing Ganymede's surface consists of contrasting ancient dark terrain and young bright terrain (King &amp; Fletcher, in review). The dark terrain (e.g. Galileo Regio) has high abundances of a spectrally flat darkening agent which appears to have a uniformly low albedo (~15%) across Ganymede's surface. Water ice is most abundant in young bright terrain (e.g. sulci) and appears most abundant in large impact craters. The water ice grain size distribution shows strong latitudinal and longitudinal trends, which appear to be caused by thermal and radiation gradients respectively (see Figure 2). Lower abundances of hydrated salts and sulphuric acid were detected, with modelling uncertainties making it difficult to identify the exact mixture of salts present on Ganymede's surface.Absorption bands and spectral slopes were analysed in the visible wavelength VLT/MUSE spectra of Ganymede. One of the most distinguishing features of Ganymede's visible spectrum is the molecular oxygen absorption at 577.3 nm (see Figure 3). The spatial distribution of this absorption band shows latitudinal and longitudinal trends, with the strongest absorptions found at low to mid latitudes on the trailing hemisphere in Ganymede's closed magnetic field line region.Figure 2: Modelled water ice best estimate spatial distributions using MCMC modelling of near-IR VLT/SPHERE observations. Total water ice abundance (top) is highest in young bright terrain, while the grain size (bottom) shows strong latitudinal and longitudinal trends.

      "abstract": "IntroductionEuropa's surface is the youngest of the icy satellites and shows signs of recent activity [1]. The main driver of this activity is Jupiter's tidal forces which are responsible for the existence of a global water ocean underneath Europa's icy crust [2]. This ocean is thought to be in a direct contact with the rocky mantle [3] creating a potential environment for the emergence of life.This places Europa at the center of future space exploration with NASA's Europa Clipper mission [4] as well as ESA's JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) that will more generally study the Jovian icy moons [5].To prepare for those missions, it is crucial to get the most out of the data we currently have. Photometry plays a key role in deriving remote sensing science products. As such, photometric correction is often the first step of any remote sensing analysis such as mapping or spectroscopy. In itself, photometry is closely linked to the surface microtexture and can help us better understand its physical state [e.g. 6, 7]. In this work, we are deriving photometric parameters for selected areas of Europa - we analyze their spectral dependency and how that can be translated into physical properties. DatasetWe are revisiting data from Galileo's Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) [8] that operated between 0.7 - 5.2 m.Calibrated and georeferenced data cubes (g-cubes) archived in the PDS Imaging Node have been stored in a database [9] with relevant information such as longitude, latitude, wavelengths, reflectance value, photometric angles etc. This tool allows for a comprehensive view of the dataset and quick exploration to assess the surface and angle coverage available for our study.Due to changes in the wavelengths calibration and detector failures during operations, the phase angle coverage is very variable across the spectrum (from one cube to the other) with ranges from a few degrees to 80 degrees. We favor spectral intervals with a dense phase coverage. Moreover, to accommodate the shift in the wavelengths reference over time as well as to maximize our geometric diversity, we will not be looking at specific wavelengths but at 40 nm wide ranges of wavelengths across the spectrum.We retrieved the reflectance and geometry information for a selection of regions of interest across the surface (Figure 1) by finding a compromise between interesting regions and relevant phase angle and spectral coverage.Figure 1: Map of Europa (credits: Björn Jónsson) with studied areas highlighted Estimation of photometric parametersFor each area we are considering, we estimated a set of photometric parameters for every 40 nm wavelength interval we have defined. For this work, we are considering Hapke's direct model detailed in [10] and [11]. Six parameters are to be estimated: phase function (b, c), single-scattering albedo (ω), rugosity (θ ̅), opposition effect (h and B_0).We used an estimation method based on Bayesian statistics and that we developed for our regional studies of Jupiter's icy moons in the visible [12, 13, 14]. This allows for of the parameters was inferred except for their physical domain of variation. The posterior Probability Density Functions (PDFs) are sampled with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm.ResultsWe analyzed the different parameters over our three areas of study. Results were very heterogeneous in terms of accuracy across the spectrum but it is clear that the photometric parameters do vary somewhat with the wavelength, as also observed in laboratory experiment [15].Figure 2 shows the example of the single-scattering albedo and macroscopic roughness estimations between 700 nm and 5 μm for ROI#1 in the leading hemisphere and a sample of wavelengths for which we have well constrained results.Even though with naïve theoretical considerations we would expect a constant roughness - independent of wavelength - we found here that θ ̅ seems to become more important with higher wavelengths and lower reflectance. This could be related to specific absorption patterns or the presence of certain inclusions that would influence the photometric behavior in preferred wavelengths. In addition, roughness, as observed at various scales determined by the wavelength, may differ in natural material. This phenomenon is known as scale dependence roughness and may play a role here. Here we confirm the first-order dependence of absorptivity and roughness, determined in laboratory measurements [15]. Figure 2: Spectral evolution of the single scattering albedo (left) and the macroscopic roughness (right) for ROI#1 estimated via mean of posterior distribution (blue) and maximum likelihood (orange)Conclusion and future workBased on this work, we aim at locally derive photometric corrections that can be used for other remote sensing products like mapping and spectroscopy. The physical implications of a spectrally dependent macroscopic roughness or phase function might also contribute to a better understanding of the history of Europa's surface and will be our primary focus going forward.Studying the spectral dependence of the Hapke parameters specifically is interesting as this model is one of the most widely used to investigate radiative transfer in relation to planetary surfaces. Nonetheless, a lot of different photometric models could also be considered. We plan to complement this work by studying the spectral dependency of other photometric models [e.g. 14, 16].

      "abstract": "In 2005, a new type of mass spectrometer was commercialised for the first time, the Thermo Fisher Scientific OrbitrapTM. Using a Quadro-Logarithmic Electrostatic Ion Trap technology, Orbitrap mass spectrometers are able to reach ultra-high mass resolution1. For a decade, the Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie de l'Environnement et de l'Espace (LPC2E) is developing a spatialised version of the Orbitrap, the CosmOrbitrap2, to bring this high resolution in space exploration. The CosmOrbitrap is intended to be the mass analyser and acquisition system of laser ablation mass spectrometers aiming for planetary bodies like Europa or the Moon3,4.In this context, OLYMPIA - Orbitrap anaLYser MultiPle IonisAtion - has been develop to be used as a new laboratory test bench, and is adaptable to different ionisation methods. After a successful study of planetary atmosphere analogues using Electron Ionisation (EI)5, we now coupled OLYMPIA with the Laser Induced Liquid Beam Ion Desorption technique to analyse liquid water samples. For example, LILBID is able to accurately reproduce hypervelocity impact ionisation icy grains mass spectra6, such as those recorded by the Comic Dust Analyser7 (CDA) onboard Cassini in the vicinity of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus. The LILBID setup is usually coupled with a Time-of-Flight (TOF) mass spectrometer, with a mass resolution of ~800 m/Δm. By coupling the LILBID technique to OLYMPIA and its Orbitrap analyser, we are now able to record hypervelocity icy grains analogue mass spectra with ultra-high mass resolution. The setup is currently able to measure H2O+ and H3O+ ions with a mass resolution of around 150.000 m/Δm (FWHM), with the spectral appearance matching mass spectra of icy grains impact ionisation in an impact velocity range of 15 to 20km/s. Future work aims to simulate lower impact velocities below 15 km/s as they are typically expected for flyby or orbiter missions.Those results will be implemented in the LILBID database8, and will be useful for the calibration and future data interpretation of the SUrface Dust Analyser (SUDA) mass spectrometer9, which will be onboard NASA's Europa Clipper mission10 to characterize the habitability of Jupiter's icy moon Europa.

      "abstract": "Introduction : Europa's surface is one of the youngest surfaces in the solar system. The great diversity of morphologies observed quickly raised the question of the processes responsible for this active resurfacing. The Jovian moon is believed to hide a global liquid water ocean under its ice crust [1] which led to the assumptions of exchange between the surface and the putative subsurface ocean [1]. In addition, Europa is exposed to intense space weathering due to the continuous bombardment by electrons and ions from Jupiter's magnetosphere [2]. The surface therefore appears as the key witness of these internal and external processes.To finely characterize the microphysics of the ice it is necessary to use radiative transfer (RT) modeling. Such modeling allows to estimate these parameters integrating the highly nonlinear effects of the light path within the icy regolith due to scattering. A recent work has been proposed to determine surface properties using Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) [3]. This approach is based on RT models [4,5] using the optical properties of the considered chemical species and physical properties of the regolith. Here we report the use of a RT model [5] in a Bayesian MCMC inference framework to retrieve microphysical properties of Europa's surface using the Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) hyperspectral data [6].Data: We use data acquired by NIMS collected during the Galileo mission. Here we present the analysis of calibrated data from the hyperspectral cube \"e6007ci\" (available from the PDS archive) from the trailing Anti-jovian hemisphere (Fig. 1). The estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is between 5 and 50, we mainly focus on the 1.0-2.5 µm region for which the SNR is higher. Within this spectral range the uncertainty on the absolute calibration is up to 10% [7].Radiative transfer model requires the optical constants of the pure chemical species considered. Here we consider 15 different compounds: crystalline and amorphous water ice [7,8], sulfuric acid octahydrate (SAO; [2]), hydrated sulfates [9,10], hydrated chlorine salts [11], and minerals such as magnetite [12], sodium chloride [13] and ammonium sulfate [14].Figure 1 - (top): Map of Europa with a zoom on Harmonia Linea observation. The color represents the reflectance at 0.7 µm normalized using the Lommel-Seegler law. (bottom): all spectra from the corresponding cube and the selected spectra (S1 and S2) used in this study.Method: We use a MCMC Bayesian inference approach [15,16] to analyze NIMS spectra because it has the advantage of allowing the exploration of a large parameter space and looking for non-unique solutions while statistically constraining the model parameters [17,18]. We compute the bidirectional reflectance of the regolith using a RT model [5]. Then, the algorithm is used to sample the parameter space following the Bayesian Posterior distribution. The parameters we are adjusting are: abundances, grain size of each chemical species and macroscopic roughness of the regolith. For the abundances we use a Dirichlet prior to ensure that they are sum up to 1, while we use a uniform distribution prior for the other parameters.A first study was done to test all combination of 3, 4 and 5 chemical species among the 15 compounds on the S1 spectrum to select the most appropriate chemical species to consider for the surface characterization. For each of this combination (4823 in total), we perform the MCMC inversion.Results: We first discuss the chemical species selection (called here endmember) by looking at all best-fit from all combination of 3, 4 and 5 endmembers and their associated RMS. We first show that going from 3 to 4 endmembers significantly improves the quality of the fit while using 5 endmembers only slightly improve it. In addition, some compounds appear necessary to reproduce the observation, such as water ice and SAO. We show that adding either hydrated sulfates or chlorine salts produces results substantially similar. Fig. 2 illustrates such results when considering 4 endmembers. Finally we perform MCMC inversion with 5 endmembers including both crystalline and amorphous water ice. The best fit from the 5 endmembers model and their associated posterior pairwise distribution are shown fig. 3 and 4 for the S1 and S2 spectra.Figure 2 - Results of all combination for the 4 endmembers case: only the best-fit with RMS below 0.016 are showed.Figure 3 - results for S1: best fit (left) and pairwise posterior distribution (right) using 5 endmembers.Figure 4 - results for S2: best fit (left) and pairwise posterior distribution (right) using 5 endmembers. Conclusion: We tested, for the first time and in a systematic way, the inversion of Galileo NIMS infrared spectra using a significant number of 3, 4 and 5 compounds combinations out of a selection of 15 chemical compounds, using a non-linear radiative transfer model. We found that there is no unique solution to determine the exact composition of the surface, but a family of endmember are required: water ice, SAO and sulfates. This composition set seems to be coherent for both bright and dark regions of Europa. We will discuss the implication of these results on the Europa's surface processes.References: [1] Pappalardo, R. et al. (1999) JGR. [2] Carlson, R. W. et al. (2005) Icar. [3] Mishra, I. et al.

      "abstract": "Introduction The reliable identification and quantification of biosignatures on extraterrestrial ocean worlds is key to the search for life in our Solar System. Saturn's moon Enceladus, and potentially Jupiter's moon Europa, emit plumes of gas and ice grains formed from subsurface water into space (Spahn et al. 2006, Roth et al. 2014). The ice grains can be sampled during spacecraft flybys by impact ionization mass spectrometers, such as the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA; Srama et al. 2004) on board the past Cassini mission, the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA; Kempf et al. 2014) on board the upcoming Europa Clipper mission (Howell &amp; Pappalardo 2020), or the ENceladus Ice Analyzer (ENIA), proposed for future Enceladus missions (Reh et al. 2016). CDA data collected in the Saturnian System revealed that Enceladus's ocean is salty (Postberg et al. 2009) and contains a variety of organic material, including complex macromolecules (Postberg et al. 2018) as well as low-mass volatile compounds (Khawaja et al. 2019), some of which could potentially act as amino acid precursors. Our recent detection of phosphates in ice grains emitted by Enceladus (Postberg et al. 2022) further enhances Enceladus's potential as a habitable environment, possibly able to support microbial life in its subsurface ocean. However, biosignatures have not yet been identified on extraterrestrial ocean worlds. Impact ionization detectors, such as SUDA or ENIA, are the only instruments capable of determining the compositions of single µm-sized ice grains emitted into plumes. Cassini CDA results showed that refractory organics occur in only a few % of plume ice grains. These are thought to form from an organic film covering the oceanic surface (Postberg et al., 2018). Cell material, if present, would likely reside in such grains and would only be present in an even smaller number of ice grains, maybe just one in a thousand or less. On Earth, 70% of the planetary surface is covered by a biofilm, the surface microlayer on top of the ocean water (Flemming and Wuertz, 2019), which hosts a distinct microbial community at cell densities 3 - 5 orders of magnitude higher than in the bulk water phase (Franklin et al. 2005). After lifting, organics and cells from this layer can initiate ice crystal formation in clouds (Pratt et al. 2009). Methods and Results To simulate such a scenario, where biosignatures are only present in a small fraction of emitted grains, but with a high cell density, we conducted laboratory analogue experiments with Sphingopyxis alaskensis, an ultrasmall bacterium, extracted from various cold marine environments (Ting et al. 2010) and potentially capable of fitting into µm-sized ice grains. We simulated the case of an ice grain of 15µm in diameter - constituting the worst case for Enceladus where ice grains are generally much smaller (1-5 µm in diameter) - formed from a nucleation core of one single bacterial cell. We used Laser Induced Liquid Beam Ion Desorption (LILBID) - a proven technique to simulate accurately impact ionization mass spectra of ice grains recorded in space (Klenner et al. 2019, 2020, 2020a). Recent LILBID experiments predict that DNA and lipids extracted from bacterial cultures will produce characteristic signals in the mass spectra of ice grains emitted from ocean worlds (Dannenmann et al. 2022, under review). Here we present the next steps - LILBID experiments with otherwise untreated lysed bacterial cells simulating the appearance of these microbial life forms in impact ionization mass spectra. In both polarity mass spectra, we clearly identify signatures of S. alaskensis. Cation mass spectra exhibit features due to protonated amino acids, either fragments of the bacteria's proteins or metabolic intermediates. Deprotonated fatty acids, fragments of bacterial lipids, are identifiable in anion mass spectra. Our experiments show that even if less than 0.1% of the cell constituents would form a nucleation core of a 15µm ice grain, the bacterial signature would be apparent in the data. The recorded spectra are part of a comprehensive database containing analogue data for impact ionization mass spectrometers on board spacecraft (Klenner et al. 2022, under review). Conclusions Our results show that biosignatures deriving from a single bacterial cell - or small fractions of it - embedded as a nucleation core in an ice grain will be clearly identifiable in impact ionization mass spectra from SUDA-type instruments. This demonstrates the advantage of analyzing individual ice grains in a plume over analyzing the average composition of all plume material encountered during a flyby. A modern impact ionization instrument like SUDA or ENIA would be capable of recording 10,000 - 100,000 ice grain spectra (cations and anions) during a single plume passage, allowing to assess biosignatures that are present in only 1 out of 100,000 grains during a multiple flyby mission. Such low abundances would be out of reach for other analytical methods that measure the integrated - and thus extremely diluted - concentrations of such biosignatures in a plume.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The habitability of Europa is a property within a system, with many interdependent physical and chemical parameters, among a number of processes, of which no single measurement or investigation can characterize. Therefore, investigating Europa as an integrated system must occur to understand the complete picture. To accomplish this, the Europa Clipper mission has three main mission objectives to assess Europa's habitability: (1) characterize the Ice Shell and Ocean: including their heterogeneity, properties, and the nature of surface-ice-ocean exchange; (2) characterize the Composition: understanding Europa's ocean through investigations of the composition and chemistry; (3) and characterize the Geology: including surface features and high-science-interest localities. Europa Clipper will also assess any current or recent activity by searching for evidence of thermal anomalies and plumes and will perform high resolution observations to provide reconnaissance for a future potential landed mission. Synthesizing the mission's science measurements in such a way as to constrain Europa's habitability is a complex task and is being guided by the Habitability Assessment Board (HAB).The HAB is charged with providing a high-level, cross-instrument and cross-discipline, habitability-driven science perspective. All members of the Europa Clipper Science Team are considered members of the HAB and so contribute to addressing the overarching goal of the mission. Rotating members of the science team serve as leadership of the HAB and convene regular meetings to discuss and formulate recommendations to the project's science leadership. Particularly, HAB works to connect activities and measurements across the Europa Clipper Geology, Composition, and Interior Working Groups to investigate habitability and can recommend formation of focus groups of experts on the team to address scientific and technical problems related to habitability.System Science: To achieve mission level 1 requirements and assess Europa's habitability, investigations will contribute observations towards science themes. Themes that support the Ice Shell and Ocean characterization include Full Depth Subsurface Exchange, Shallow Subsurface Structure, Ice Shell Properties, and Ocean Properties. For Composition characterization, themes that contribute include Global Composition Surface Mapping, Regional Composition, Atmospheric Composition, and Space Environment Composition. The Geology objective has contributions of Global Surface Mapping, Landform Geology, and Local Scale Surface Properties (which also contributes to reconnaissance). Current activity is supported by Remote Plume Search (and Characterization, if applicable), In-Situ Plume Search (and Characterization, if applicable), Surface Thermal Anomaly Search, and Surface Activity Evidence.Current Activity: Searches for and characterization of any recent activity would greatly contribute to assessing Europa's habitability. Europa Clipper plans observations for potential activity through remote observations including: the Europa-Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS) instrument through occultations, aurora, and UV scans; the Europa Imaging System (EIS) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) through high resolution imaging; and the Europa Thermal Imaging System (E-THEMIS) through thermal infrared mapping. Additionally, in-situ measurements by the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA) will also make observations of activity through detections of positive and negative ions and characterization of particle compositions and their locations of origin on the surface. Contributions by the other instruments will also inform on current/recent activity through remote and in-situ observations through magnetic, plasma, radar, and compositional measurements.Remote observations to search for (and characterize if present) current activity at Europa by ground based, near-earth orbiting observatories, and other spacecraft could also occur, even while Europa Clipper is in transit to Jupiter. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have made putative detections of plume activity at Europa (Roth et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016) and future observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and ground-based observatories may be able to confirm these findings. JWST can make measurements in the mid-infrared, for which the Galilean moons are relatively poorly characterized, enabling further constraints on composition and mechanisms driving the activity. Other observatories including the Very Large Telescope (VLT), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and measurements by the Juno spacecraft and future JUICE mission could all contribute further to assessing Europa's potential activity and habitability. The Europa Clipper science team is currently working to informally coordinate efforts with the JUICE team to enhance our science as possible at Europa on a non-interference basis.Summary: Europa Clipper will assess the habitability of Europa as a system, guided by the HAB, through the synergy of multiple measurements and incorporation of remote observations by JWST and other remote observatories and spacecraft. Potential detections (and subsequent characterization) of any activity would greatly contribute to understanding Europa's habitability and potential to harbor life.

      "abstract": "Introduction: With a launch readiness date of late 2024, NASA's Europa Clipper will set out on a journey to explore the habitability of Jupiter's moon Europa. In the early 2030s, the spacecraft will enter Jupiter orbit then fly by Europa nearly 50 times to collect data on Europa's ice shell and ocean, study its composition, investigate its geology, and search for and characterize any current activity. The mission's science objectives will be accomplished using a highly capable suite of remote-sensing and in-situ instruments.Mission Context: Interpretation of Galileo mission data suggests that Europa likely hides a global saltwater ocean beneath the icy surface. Chemistry at the ice surface and ocean-rock interface might provide the building blocks for life. NASA's Europa Clipper mission is intended to assess Europa's potential habitability.The Voyager and Galileo missions first revealed a deformed surface at Europa with an average surface age younger than Earth's, dominated by water ice and renewed through recent or current geologic activity. Galileo data indicates that Europa has an induced magnetic field, implying the presence of a global, electrically conductive fluid layer beneath the surface, most likely a saltwater ocean. Geological data including structural patterns are also consistent with a subsurface ocean. Recent observations also suggest the presence of plumes may release internal water into space, indicating the potential for additional shallow water reservoirs beneath Europa's icy surface.There are many open questions regarding the viability of Europa to support life. Intense radiation from Jupiter at Europa's surface forms water and impurities into oxidants, chemical reagents capable of carrying out oxidation. Active geologic cycling of seawater through rocky material on the Europan seafloor is expected to be chemically reducing. If mixing between the surface oxidants and the reduced ocean water occurs, there is an opportunity in Europa's ocean or ice shell to produce a reduction-oxidation (redox) potential. All known life on Earth relies on such redox potentials to extract chemical energy from the environment in exchange for heat energy and entropy, enabling cellular maintenance, metabolism, and reproduction. Europa may have the ingredients that could support life: liquid water, bioessential elements, chemical energy, and a stable environment through time.Science Goal and Objectives: The overarching goal of the Europa Clipper mission is to explore Europa to investigate its habitability. This will be achieved through the accomplishment of three science objectives:Characterize the ice shell and any subsurface water, including their heterogeneity, ocean properties, and the nature of surface-ice- exchange. Understand the habitability of Europa's ocean through composition and chemistry. Understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent or current activity, and characterize high science interest localities. Science Payload: The remote sensing payload consists of the Europa Ultraviolet Spectrograph (Europa-UVS), the Europa Imaging System (EIS), the Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE), the Europa Thermal Imaging System (E-THEMIS), and the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON). The in-situ instruments comprise the Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM), the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA), and the MAss Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (MASPEX). Gravity and Radio Science (G/RS) will be achieved using the spacecraft's telecommunication system, and valuable scientific data will be acquired by the spacecraft's Radiation Monitoring system (RADMON).Status and Advancement Toward Launch: Both the spacecraft and the payload are currently under construction, as the mission begins its assembly, testing, and launch operations (ATLO) phase. Recent major milestones include selection of a launch vehicle and launch readiness date by NASA, evaluation of candidate tours by the science team, and preparations for the cruise and operational phases of the mission. The project, flight system, and payload have completed their Critical Design Reviews, and the project has completed its System Integration Review. Europa Clipper is now formerly a Phase D mission. Meanwhile, the science team is preparing a set of manuscripts describing the mission's science and instruments for publication in the journal Space Science Reviews.One Team Philosophy: Our \"One Team\" philosophy prioritizes synergistic science by bridging across the individual instrument-based investigations, while promoting collaborations among members of the Europa Clipper science team. Each of the Europa Clipper individual instruments will be used to investigate Europa and its environs, finding critical clues about how Europa works as a planetary body. In combining and assessing the datasets from each instrument's experiments, we can collectively gain clarity into Europa's mysteries. It is at the overlapping boundaries of our subfields that the greatest insights and discoveries will be made. Integrated science celebrates our individual expertise, challenges our assumptions, breaks through our limitations, and expands our intellectual boundaries. Associated visibility brings trust, promotes partnerships, and enhances personal relationships. These aspirations are the inherent basis for functioning as one Europa Clipper science team.JUICE-Clipper Coordination: The JUICE spacecraft is expected to be in the Jovian system at the same time as Europa Clipper, and there is substantial overlap between these missions' primary phases. The Europa Clipper and JUICE science teams have begun informal collaboration to suggest synergistic science that could be supported on a non-interference basis. The scientific collaborations currently extend across two ad hoc working groups, one on the Galilean satellites and one on Jupiter's magnetosphere. Current discussions are to form a joint focus group to advise the two project teams on potential collaborations and propose a plan for synergistic observations, joint publications, and joint archival data products.Acknowledgments: Portions of this work were performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

      "abstract": "Events which deposit fresh material onto Europa's surface may be irregular and catastrophic, such as large-scale impacts, or localized, and potentially extant, processes in which faults, fractures, or brine transport bring subsurface liquid onto the surface. This liquid may originate from shallow reservoirs within the ice shell or directly from the subsurface ocean [1]. Emplacement may be a slow, extrusive process, or quicker, potentially with the formation of cryovolcanic plumes (e.g. [2,3,4]). Plume deposits or any other surface material can also be transported to high altitudes by another mechanism: when hypervelocity interplanetary micrometeoroids, or larger objects, impact the surface of an atmosphereless planetary body like Europa, these can generate impact ejecta with high enough velocities to reach altitudes of hundreds of kilometres [5]. Most of these ejecta particles are gravitationally bound, moving on ballistic trajectories lasting up to hundreds of seconds and producing an almost isotropic dust exosphere around Europa [6,7]. Subsurface oceans, in the Jovian and in other planetary systems, can therefore be characterized using the particles they emit, via either indirect or direct routes: 1) Detection and analysis of ejecta particles lofted by micrometeoroid impacts from those parts of the surface that recently interacted with subsurface water (e.g. certain landforms, such as chaos terrains on Europa, or plume deposits); 2) Direct sampling of plume particles in space (where plumes are present, as perhaps possible on Europa).The SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA), onboard the Europa Clipper spacecraft, is designed to measure the composition and trajectories of such impact ejecta particles and/or plume material. SUDA is an impact ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometer, which uses the ions generated by hypervelocity impacts of dust grains onto the instrument target to generate mass spectra of the impinging particles. Depending on the altitude, SUDA will be able to detect up to tens of ejected surface particles per second during each flyby, each likely to contain a wide variety of organic and/or inorganic compounds, and via trajectory reconstruction, map them to their origins on the surface [8].At global scales, landform evolution on atmosphereless bodies is primarily driven by impact gardening and tectonics. The tectonic regime that dominates within Europa's ice shell is likely to be extensional, a hypothesis supported by numerous lines of evidence, such as the widespread presence of dilational bands that represent &gt;40% of the total surface area [9]. Several types of geological features generated within such a tectonic regime, including chaos terrains and fossae, might affect the emplacement of buried material and subsequent exposure of fresh volatiles on Europa's surface.Chaos Terrains are, on Europa, geologically very young and extensively disrupted surface features, interpreted as reflecting recent interaction with subsurface material [10]. Leading-hemisphere chaos regions have recently been shown to be compositionally distinct from their surroundings, probably indicating contributions from endogenous sodium chloride sourced from the subsurface ocean [11,12]. Fossae are long, narrow depressions (troughs). The term is used for topographic features that occur on extraterrestrial planetary surfaces, whose exact origin is uncertain, although they are thought to be the result of extensional tectonic processes [13].Here we investigate two neighboring features on Europa, Ménec Fossae and Thrace Macula (a chaos terrain), for which we produced high-resolution photoclinometrically-derived [14] digital terrain models (DTMs, Fig. 1) and geomorphological-structural maps (Fig. 2). Our preliminary results suggest that this area of Europa has undergone transtensional (strike-slip paired with extension) tectonic activity, as indicated by the orientation and relationship of the faults and fossae. Such tectonic style has possibly created a pathway facilitating the ascent of subsurface material, especially volatiles, that play an important role in the formation of chaos terrain. These results will help ascertain the most likely regions on Europa in which to find fresh material, representative of the subsurface ocean, and be used as input data for dust ejecta trajectory models that will ultimately assist the mass spectrometer Surface Dust Analyzer (SUDA), onboard the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, in compositionally mapping Europa's surface [15].

      "abstract": "1. IntroductionWith a launch readiness date of late 2024, NASA's Europa Clipper will set out on a journey to explore the habitability of Jupiter's moon Europa. Among others, observations by Europa Clipper's in-situ instruments will provide an understanding of the satellite's interior structure and compositional makeup. The variability of Jupiter's magnetic field at Europa induces electric currents within the moon's conducting ocean layer, the magnitude of which depends on the ocean's location, extent, and conductivity. Europa is also embedded in a flow of corotating plasma, which continuously impacts and sputters the surface to produce the moon's atmosphere. In addition, micrometeorite impacts eject particles of the surface to wrap Europa in a cloud of dust. The neutral atmosphere is readily ionized by energetic particles to produce an ionosphere, which gives rise to current systems electromagnetically connecting Europa to Jupiter. The in-situ instruments comprise the Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM), the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS), the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA), and the MAss Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (MASPEX). We present the highlights of these instruments' development on their path to delivery to assembly, test, and launch operations (ATLO), which have begun in March 2022. 2. Relevant Investigations2.1. Europa Clipper MagnetometerThe Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM) will measure magnetic fields generated by currents induced in Europa's subsurface ocean and the electromagnetic coupling of the moon to Jupiter. Jupiter's tilted dipole magnetic field and Europa's eccentric orbit expose the moon to time-varying magnetic fields inducing eddy currents in the ocean. By measuring the induced field response at multiple frequencies, the ice shell thickness and the ocean layer thickness and conductivity can be uniquely determined. The ECM consists of three fluxgate sensors mounted on an 8.5-m-long boom and a control electronics hosted in a vault shielding it from radiation damage. The use of three sensors allows for dynamic removal of higher-order spacecraft-generated magnetic fields. The flight-model (FM) sensors (Figure 1) have been delivered to Instrument Integration and Testing, and the instrument is awaiting calibration in the fall of 2022.Figure 1. ECM FM fluxgate sensor.2.2. Plasma Instrument for Magnetic SoundingThe Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS) will measure ions and electrons in Europa's ionosphere to quantify magnetic fields associated with electric currents driven by dynamic pressure gradients, which are produced by the interaction of corotating Jovian plasma with Europa and its neutral atmosphere. PIMS will further measure the particle population precipitating onto Europa to model surface sputtering rates and constrain the effects of space weathering. In addition, PIMS will characterize the distribution of electrons carrying field-aligned currents coupling Europa to Jupiter's ionosphere. The PIMS instrument consists of two sensors each hosting two Faraday cups with a 90° field of view. The instrument measures electrons and ions with energies of up to 2 keV and 7 keV/q, respectively, with an energy resolution of &lt;15% and a temporal resolution of 1-4 s. The instrument, including sensor assemblies (Figure 2), is scheduled for delivery to ATLO in June 2022.Figure 2. PIMS FM Fully Integrated Sensor Assemblies2.3. Mass Spectrometer for Planetary ExplorationThe MAss Spectrometer for Planetary Exploration (MASPEX) measures trace neutral species to determine the composition of Europa's atmosphere. The atmosphere is produced by particles sputtering off the surface, is augmented by possible contributions from plumes, and is altered by radiolysis. MASPEX will determine the distribution of major volatiles and key organic compounds with respect to latitude and longitude, altitude, solar local time, and will distinguish endogenic and exogenic sources. MASPEX is a multi-bounce time-of-flight mass spectrometer for species with atomic mass ranging from 2 to 500 u. The instrument's mass resolution m/Dm of 4275 at mass 50 enables measurement of individual fragment ions generated by electron impact ionization of parent molecule. The FM instrument is presently undergoing testing (Figure 3) and is scheduled for delivery to ATLO in August 2022.Figure 3. Testing of FM MASPEX instrument.2.4. Surface Dust AnalyzerThe SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA) will map the chemical composition of particles ejected from Europa's surface by hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids. The dust particles have a typical size of 0.5-1 μm and exhibit a near isotropic distribution and only weak temporal variations. Small fluctuations are expected from variability of exogenous sources, resulting, e.g., from the orbital motion of sources on Io and the stochastic nature of volcanic activity. SUDA is a time-of-flight mass spectrometer for species with atomic mass ranging of up to 200 u and is capable of detecting up to 40 ejecta per second. Owing to the deterministic nature of the ballistic trajectories of the ejected particles, the composition measurements at spacecraft altitude can be correlated with geologic features on the surface. It has been demonstrated that trace amounts of complex organic species embedded in ice grains with abundances &lt;0.1 ppm can be detected. In addition to micrometeorite ejecta, SUDA will measure the makeup of potential plumes by directly sampling microscopic particles. The FM sensor assembly (Figure 4) will be delivered to ATLO in August 2022 as part of the instrument.Figure 4. SUDA FM sensor assembly.3. Mission ConceptThe current mission design consists of 49 flybys of Europa executed over a ~3.5 year period while the spacecraft is in orbit about Jupiter. The altitudes of closest approach typically range from 25 km to 100 km. The tour is divided into two principal campaigns, visiting first the anti-Jovian hemisphere followed by observations of the sub-Jovian hemisphere. The flybys occur over a wide range of latitudes and longitudes (Figure 5), and they are widely distributed in true anomaly and solar local time. The tour is thus well suited for characterization of the ice shell and ocean and of the atmosphere and ionosphere created through Europa's interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere.Figure 5. Planned Europa Clipper close approach ground tracks below 1000 km altitude (black), 400 km (green), 100 km yellow, and 50 km (red).",

      "abstract": "Jupiter's moon Europa is a prime target in the exploration of potentially habitable extraterrestrial ocean worlds. Its global subsurface ocean is likely in contact with a rocky silicate seafloor [1] and may have provided a long-term, stable environment with essential elements and energy sources for an independent origin of life [2]. Biogenic, prebiotic, or abiotic organic material from the ocean could be incorporated in ice grains ejected from the surface due to micrometeorite impacts [3] or in potential cryovolcanic plumes [4]. These ice grains could be detected during spacecraft flybys by the SUrface Dust Analyzer (SUDA [5]), an impact ionization mass spectrometer on board NASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission [6]. SUDA-type instruments are powerful tools for the identification of organic molecules, as demonstrated by the detection of complex organic macromolecules [7] and smaller reactive nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing compounds [8] in ice grains formed from Enceladus's subsurface ocean by SUDA's predecessor instrument, the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) [9] on board the Cassini spacecraft. These findings required laboratory analogue experiments using the Laser Induced Liquid Beam Ion Desorption (LILBID) approach, a proven technique for the investigation of mass spectral characteristics of organic molecules as identifiable by SUDA-type instruments. LILBID experiments have shown that bioessential molecules such as amino acids, fatty acids and peptides, as well microbial biosignatures, could be detected, and that abiotic and biotic mass spectral fingerprints could be distinguished by spaceborne impact ionization mass spectrometers down to the ppm or ppb level [10, 11, 12].In impact ionization mass spectrometry, the matrix from which a sample is analyzed can influence ion formation and the resulting spectra [13]. Simulating the mass spectra of organic compounds in ice grains ejected from Europa therefore requires consideration of matrix compounds, particularly inorganic salts which seem to be a common ingredient of Europa's surface ices [14, 15]. Here we investigate the detectability of several organic molecules (5-amino-1-pentanol, acetic acid, benzoic acid, butylamine, glucose, methanol, pyridine) containing a wide range of functional groups, namely hydroxyl, azine, (aromatic) carboxylic acid, (aromatic) amine, and alkanolamine, in salt-rich ice grains ejected from Europa. We focus on the effects of sodium chloride (NaCl), an abundant inorganic salt (0.1-1.2 mol/kg H2O [16]), on the mass spectral signatures of these organics in both cation and anion mode.Our results show that the salt-rich matrices modify the mass spectral characteristics of the organics by forming salt adducts, effectively suppressing characteristic organic peaks and complicating the spectral interpretation with interferences. We found that the spectral appearance of the organics fundamentally changes when using high (1M) NaCl concentrations as compared to low (0.01M) concentrations. At high concentrations in cation mode, the investigated organics typically form sodiated molecular ions [M+Na]+, clusters with NaCl and NaOH ([M+Na+(NaCl)]+, [M+Na+(NaOH)]+), as well as disodiated and trisodiated adduct cations ([M-H+ 2Na]+ and [M-2H+3Na]+). At the lowest salt concentration (0.01M NaCl), all the investigated organics are detected as protonated molecular peaks [M+H]+, whereas these peaks are mostly suppressed at higher NaCl concentrations. In anion mode, organics are typically detected as deprotonated molecules [M-H]-, chlorinated adducts [M+Cl]-, NaCl and NaOH clusters ([M+Cl+NaCl]-, [M+Cl+NaOH]-, [M-H+NaCl]-) at concentrations of 0.01M and 0.1M NaCl. Suppression effects of organic-related peaks are stronger in anion mode than in cation mode, and prevent the detection of most organics at the highest NaCl concentration investigated (1M), although those organics appear as salt adducts in cation spectra. By contrast, the two organic acids investigated (acetic and benzoic acid) are detected with a high sensitivity in anion mode, even at the highest salt concentration. Deprotonated molecular ions of acetic acid were identified in a 1M NaCl matrix at a concentration of 0.1vol%, whereas most other organics need to be present at least at 10 times higher concentrations to be detectable at these high salt concentrations. In both ion modes, fewer characteristic fragment ions appear in the spectra with increasing salt concentrations, possibly due to either neutralization of charged fragments or suppression of the fragmentation process of the organics. Our results confirm the necessity for SUDA to record both cation and anion mass spectra to allow the identification in salt-rich ice grains of a wide range of organic compounds with different functional groups and pH and pKa values. Ongoing complementary investigations focus on other inorganic salts or acids expected to be found in the water ice matrix of Europa, including magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which are expected to similarly induce complex matrix effects.

      "abstract": "Events which deposit fresh material onto Europa's surface may be irregular and catastrophic, such as large-scale impacts, or localized, and potentially extant, processes in which faults, fractures, or brine transport bring subsurface liquid onto the surface. This liquid may originate from shallow reservoirs within the ice shell or directly from the subsurface ocean [1]. At global scales, landform evolution on atmosphereless bodies is primarily driven by impact gardening and tectonics. The tectonic regime that dominates within Europa's ice shell is likely to be extensional, a hypothesis supported by numerous lines of evidence, such as the widespread presence of dilational bands that represent &gt;40% of the total surface area [2]. Several types of geological features generated within such a tectonic regime, including chaos terrains and fossae, might affect the emplacement of buried material and subsequent exposure of fresh volatiles on Europa's surface. Chaos Terrains are, on Europa, geologically very young and extensively disrupted surface features, interpreted as reflecting recent interaction with subsurface material [3]. Leading-hemisphere chaos regions have recently been shown to be compositionally distinct from their surroundings, probably indicating contributions from endogenous sodium chloride sourced from the subsurface ocean [4,5]. Fossae are long, narrow depressions (troughs). The term is used for topographic features that occur on extraterrestrial planetary surfaces, whose exact origin is uncertain, although they are thought to be the result of extensional tectonic processes [6]. Here we investigate two neighboring features on Europa, Ménec Fossae and Thrace Macula (a chaos terrain), for which we produced high-resolution photoclinometrically-derived digital terrain models (DTMs) and geomorphological-structural maps. Our preliminary results suggest that this area of Europa has undergone transtensional (strike-slip paired with extension) tectonic activity, as indicated by the orientation and relationship of the faults and fossae. Such tectonic style has possibly created a pathway facilitating the ascent of subsurface material, especially volatiles, that play an important role in the formation of chaos terrain. These results will help ascertain the most likely regions on Europa in which to find fresh material, representative of the subsurface ocean, and be used as input data for dust ejecta trajectory models that will ultimately assist the mass spectrometer Surface Dust Analyzer (SUDA), onboard the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, in compositionally mapping Europa's surface [7]. 1.

      "abstract": "Europa and Ganymede, whose liquid water oceans are of uncertain thickness, are subject to tidal forces across a broad frequency spectrum. Tidal deformation is inherently frequency dependent, an effect which is enhanced when a subsurface ocean is present. We model the tidal response of Europa and Ganymede, taking into account ocean dynamics and the viscoelastic coupling to the ice shell. Tidal deformation at high frequencies - a result of moon-moon interactions - is resonantly amplified by ocean dynamics. We find the corresponding tidal Love numbers to be extremely sensitive to ocean thickness and weakly sensitive to ice shell thickness, shear modulus, and viscosity. Measuring these high-frequency deformations would provide a unique determination of ocean thickness, though the minimum sensitivity required to detect the relevant deformation (0.1 mm, 2 nGal) makes this an extreme challenge. Detection of a large signal on the order of centimeters would only be possible if the ocean was tuned to a particular thickness, which would suggest that moon-moon tides play a role in the thermal/orbital evolution of the moon. Scaling laws are also derived that predict the resonant enhancement of tidal Love numbers and associated tidal dissipation in the ocean and ice shell.",

There exist numerous theoretical and numerical models for chaos formation, but to date there has been a lack of quantifiable observations that can be used to constrain models and permit comparison to the outputs of these chaos models. Here, we use mapping and statistical analysis to develop a quantitative description of chaos terrain and their observed morphologies. For nine chaos features, we map every block, or region of pre-existing terrain within disrupted matrix. We demonstrate that chaos terrains follow a continuous spectrum of morphologies between two endmembers, platy and knobby. We find that any given chaos terrain's morphology can be quantified by means of the linearized exponential slope of its cumulative block area distribution. This quantitative metric provides a new diagnostic parameter in future studies of chaos terrain formation and comparison.",

      "abstract": "Expressions of strike-slip faulting are well documented on multiple ocean worlds (e.g., Europa, Enceladus, and Ganymede) and the motion along these faults is thought to be driven by variations in diurnal tidal stresses. Titan exhibits a complex and dynamic geology with a varied surface morphology developed from fluvial, aeolian, and possible cryovolcanic and tectonic activity. However, observational data are currently limited and no clear strike-slip indicators have been identified so far. Nevertheless, the inferred presence of a porous ice layer saturated with liquid hydrocarbons in Titan's shallow subsurface provides a unique environment for studying zones of frictional weakness, shear heating, and the promotion of cryovolcanism. This study examines Titan's ability to host shear deformation mechanisms, including considerations for how the presence of near-surface liquid hydrocarbons and the crustal porosity of ice significantly reduce the resistance to shear failure of strike-slip faults in flexed areas under maximum diurnal tidal stresses. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of Titan's shear failure tendencies, given optimal failure conditions that may exist due to pore fluid interactions, and we examine the possibility for strike-slip tectonics guided by Coulomb failure laws and tidal stress mechanisms. Using the SatStress tidal stress model for a Titan-appropriate rheology, we compute the diurnal tidal stress tensor and resolve shear and normal stresses onto a suite of fault orientations. We adopt plausible coefficients of friction and include the effect of a hydrostatic pore fluid pressure gradient for Titan. At shallow fault depths (&lt; 1 km) and for optimally oriented faults, this exploratory model suggests shear failure is achievable under diurnal tidal stress conditions subject to such pore fluid pressures, especially in the polar regions. Our results suggest that under these conditions, shear failure is not only possible, but may be an active deformation mechanism on the surface and in the subsurface of Titan, and could potentially serve as a pathway for the exchange of surface and subsurface materials through shear heating mechanisms. Moreover, the inference of conditions supporting strike-slip tectonism on Titan could have important implications for future Dragonfly observations and for future studies directed at better understanding the structural development of the surfaces of icy moons.",

      "abstract": "Variations in Earths length of day have long been attributed to seasonal variations in the dynamical behavior of the ocean and atmosphere, which exert time-varying torques on the solid Earth. Non-synchronous rotation of Europas ice shell, which has a moment of inertia far smaller than Earths mantle, would be analogous to these variations in Earths length of day. The tidal torque that results from Europas eccentric orbit tends to drive a rotation rate that slightly faster than synchronous, although this has never been observed. In this work we consider the skin-friction drag that must exist between Europas convective ocean and its ice shell, assessing its importance in the ice shells torque balance and therefore ability to rotate non-synchronously. We perform high-resolution 3D non-hydrostatic simulations of Europas ocean across a range of relevant Rayleigh numbers using the MIT General Circulation Model. Turbulent stresses exerted by the ocean on the base of the ice shell are diagnosed from the model following techniques used in terrestrial oceanography to calculate stresses on sea ice. The stresses are integrated over the entire surface and time-averaged to give an estimate of the net torque exerted by the ocean on the ice shell. We find that the magnitude of the oceanic torque can exceed that due to tides under some conditions of the ice-ocean drag coefficient and the ice shells tidal dissipation factor Q. The oceanic torque can act to either accelerate or decelerate the ice shell depending on the oceans Rayleigh number. Our results suggest that future studies of the long-term rotational dynamics of ocean worlds with floating ice shells should include the skin-friction torque induced by ocean dynamics in their torque balances.",

      "abstract": "Solid state convection is expected to influence the evolution and the geological activity of Ganymede [1]. The spatial distribution of tidal dissipation could influence the temperature structure of the outer ice shell and, likely, the internal processes and the geological activity. We investigate the influence of the tidal dissipation on a convective ice shell of Ganymede. We use the finite-element code ASPECT [2] to solve the Boussinesq fluid equations of the conservation of continuity, momentum and energy to simulate solid-state convection within the ice shell of Ganymede. The numerical simulations are performed in a 2-dimensional cylindrical geometry. We adopt a temperature-dependent Newtonian viscosity for the water ice, assuming diffusion creep. The spatial distribution of the tidal dissipation rate is computed adopting a Maxwellian material model [3, 4]. Preliminary results show how the convective patterns, and the thermal plumes are influenced by the spatial distribution of the tidal dissipation. We also discuss how radar sounder investigations with RIME instrument [5] on board of the ESAs JUICE mission in combination with radio science measurements of the gravity field by 3GM experiment [6] could characterize the thermal structure of Ganymedes ice shell.

      "abstract": "In the last few years, two major contributions to the asteroid database have been the eight-color and thermal radiometric surveys. The former consists of broad -band photometric measurements through eight filters spanning the 0.3 to 1.1 (mu)m wavelength range. The latter consists of thermal flux measurements at 10 and/or 20 (mu)m, and when combined with measures of the reflected light, can yield reliable estimates of their geometric albedos. Visual display of the eight-color survey data can be simplified by reducing the dimensionality of the problem. A principal components analysis was performed to accomplish this task. The analysis shows that 95 percent of the information contained in the seven independent color indices is contained in two principal components. This result is due to the fact that most asteroid spectra can be explained in terms of two absorption features, one at ultraviolet and the other at near-infrared wavelengths. The photometric and radiometric data sets were also used, along with cluster analysis techniques, to produce an improved asteroid taxonomic system. Seven major classes are now recognized and are designated A, C, D, E, M, P, and S. Three interesting minor classes are also identified: B, F, and G. Marginal evidence for an eighth major class, here called T, exists in the data, but the reality of this class awaits confirmation by further observations of potential members. Three asteroids do not fall into any of the above classes and are assigned unique designations: R (349 Dembowska), Q (1862 Apollo), and V (4 Vesta). Four E-class asteroids are now known to exist in the main belt, yet nearly twice this number exist in or near the Hungaria region. Twenty eight D-class asteroids have been identified in the outer belt, where they represent a significant fraction of the population. Five D asteroids exist in the main belt, which one lying near the inner edge of the belt, which is dominated by S-class asteroids. Two of the interesting minor classes are associated with particular dynamical families. The Nysa family, with the single exception of Nysa itself, consists entirely of class F asteroids, while the B asteroids are found almost exclusively in the Themis family. The earth-approaching population is represented by at least two objects similar to Vesta and Dembowska, which are as many as are in the entire main belt, while most of the earth-approachers are of class S.",

      "abstract": "We have used Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity data to investigate the origin and alteration of lithic types along the western rim of Noachian-aged Endeavour crater on Meridiani Planum. Two geologic units are identified along the rim: the Shoemaker and Matijevic formations. The Shoemaker formation consists of two types of polymict impact breccia: clast-rich with coarser clasts in upper units; clast-poor with smaller clasts in lower units. Comparisons with terrestrial craters show that the lower units represent more distal ejecta from at least two earlier impacts, and the upper units are proximal ejecta from Endeavour crater. Both are mixtures of target rocks of basaltic composition with subtle compositional variations caused by differences in post-impact alteration. The Matijevic formation and lower Shoemaker units represent pre-Endeavour geology, which we equate with the regional Noachian subdued cratered unit. An alteration style unique to these rocks is formation of smectite and Si- and Al-rich vein-like structures crosscutting outcrops. Post-Endeavour alteration is dominated by sulfate formation. Rim-crossing fracture zones include regions of alteration that produced Mg-sulfates as a dominant phase, plausibly closely associated in time with the Endeavour impact. Calcium-sulfate vein formation occurred over extended time, including before the Endeavour impact and after the Endeavour rim had been substantially degraded, likely after deposition of the Burns formation that surrounds and embays the rim. Differences in Mg, Ca and Cl concentrations on rock surfaces and interiors indicate that mobilization of salts by transient water has occurred recently and may be ongoing.",

      "abstract": "On Mars, large aeolian ripples with wavelengths typically 1-3 m but lacking very coarse sand at crests have been encountered by rovers and observed from orbit. These bedforms have no terrestrial counterpart and several hypotheses for origins have been proposed. This work reports results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) experiments with ANSYS Fluent under terrestrial and Martian boundary layer conditions, using the k − ω SST turbulence model to evaluate shear stress along a topographic profile of large Martian ripples at different boundary layer wind speeds. Results indicate that, compared with Earth conditions: (1) boundary layer flow along large ripples under Martian conditions is less turbulent due to higher kinematic viscosity; (2) reverse flow vortex regions from crests at ripple lee flanks are larger; and (3) shear stresses at crests of large ripples are relatively low, so ripple flattening is less likely at high wind speeds. These results indicate Martian ripples formed by the saltation impact splash mechanism should be less constrained by shear stress effects limiting growth of exposed ripple crests, because the low density Martian atmosphere applies relatively low wind related shear stress to ripple surfaces. Other origins for the large Martian ripples are not excluded, however. On Earth, very large ripples with crests unprotected by very coarse grains do not develop due to higher wind related shear stresses.",

      "abstract": "Aeolian ripples are common in sandy environments on Earth and Mars. On Earth, ripples in sorted dune sands typically are &lt;1 cm high and are erased in high winds. On Mars in similar sands, ripple wavelengths commonly exceed 2 m, with much smaller ripples superimposed. Large Martian ripple sizes and juxtaposition of multiple wavelengths have raised questions about origins and the applicability of terrestrial aeolian physics to different planetary environments. Here, two hypotheses are evaluated for large Martian ripples: (1) fluid/wind drag, analogous to ripples formed under water on Earth, as proposed previously for Martian large ripples; and (2) saltation impact splash, the mechanism creating aeolian ripples of much smaller size on Earth. This study evaluates these hypotheses with numerical experiments and Mars rover observations, and concludes that large Martian ripples develop through the saltation impact splash mechanism. The low-density Martian atmosphere enables aeolian impact ripples to grow much higher into the boundary layer before reaching maximum heights constrained by wind dynamic pressure effects at crests. In this concept, boundary layer conditions influence mature ripple heights more directly than wavelengths. On Mars, low wind dynamic pressures, combined with the impact splash mechanism, also help to explain other distinctively Martian aeolian bedforms, including large longitudinal ripples observed by rovers and orbiters, and transverse aeolian ridges (TARs) distributed widely across the Martian surface. Compared with Earth, low wind dynamic pressures on Mars permit a wider range of ripple sizes, relative ages, morphologies, and orientations in close proximity, as displayed in rover observations.",

      "abstract": "Ancient hydrology is recorded by sedimentary rocks on Mars. The most voluminous sedimentary rocks that formed during Mars' Hesperian period are sulfate-rich rocks, explored by the Opportunity rover from 2004-2012 and soon to be investigated by the Curiosity rover at Gale crater. A leading hypothesis for the origin of these sulfates is that the cations were derived from evaporation of deep-sourced groundwater, as part of a global circulation of groundwater. Global groundwater circulation would imply sustained warm Earthlike conditions on Early Mars. Global circulation of groundwater including infiltration of water initially in equilibrium with Mars' CO<SUB>2</SUB> atmosphere implies subsurface formation of carbonate. We find that the CO<SUB>2</SUB> sequestration implied by the global groundwater hypothesis for the origin of sulfate-rich rocks on Mars is 30-5000 bars if the Opportunity data are representative of Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks, which is so large that (even accounting for volcanic outgassing) it would bury the atmosphere. This disfavors the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from upwelling of deep-sourced groundwater. If, instead, Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks are approximated as pure Mg-sulfate (no Fe), then the CO<SUB>2</SUB> sequestration is 0.3-400 bars. The low end of this range is consistent with the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from upwelling of deep-sourced groundwater. In both cases, carbon sequestration by global groundwater circulation actively works to terminate surface habitability, rather than being a passive marker of warm Earthlike conditions. Curiosity will soon be in a position to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Our work links Mars sulfate cation composition, carbon isotopes, and climate change.",

Analyses of rover and orbiter data, combined with landscape evolution modeling using Bopolu topography as a starting point, demonstrate that significant weathering and fluvial degradation of Endeavour occurred during the Noachian Period, with 0.3 km of vertical rim removal, 0.9-km backwasting of the rim, and deposition of 0.5 km of fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine sediments on the crater floor, sourced from rim erosion. Pediments formed on external rim segments, with characteristic thin regolith covers over graded bedrock. Late Noachian to Early Hesperian age Grasberg formation draping sediments, and Burns formation sulfate-rich sandstones, subsequently embayed all but high standing Shoemaker formation rocks. Burns formation strata accumulated in the crater interior up to a depth of 0.8 km. Subsequent wind erosion of the interior deposits is indicated by an interior mound and moat, together with yardangs carved into Shoemaker formation rocks, and graded topographic profiles from Grasberg and Burns formation rocks up and through the interior rim Shoemaker formation outcrops. Up to 0.4 km of Burns formation rocks were exhumed from within the crater by wind erosion to produce the mound and moat.",

Four major units occur in the region (oldest to youngest): the Matijevic, Shoemaker, Grasberg, and Burns formations. The Matijevic formation, consisting of fine-grained clastic sediments, is the only pre-Endeavour-impact unit and might be part of the Noachian etched units of Meridiani Planum. The Shoemaker formation is a heterogeneous polymict impact breccia; its lowermost member incorporates material eroded from the underlying Matijevic formation. The Shoemaker formation is a close analog to the Bunte Breccia of the Ries Crater, although the average clast sizes are substantially larger in the latter. The Grasberg formation is a thin, fine-grained, homogeneous sediment unconformably overlying the Shoemaker formation and likely formed as an airfall deposit of unknown areal extent. The Burns formation sandstone overlies the Grasberg, but compositions of the two units are distinct; there is no evidence that the Grasberg formation is a fine-grained subfacies of the Burns formation. The rocks along the Endeavour Crater rim were affected by at least four episodes of alteration in the Noachian and Early Hesperian: (i) vein formation and alteration of preimpact Matijevic formation rocks, (ii) low-water/rock alteration along the disconformity between the Matijevic and Shoemaker formations, (iii) alteration of the Shoemaker formation along fracture zones, and (iv) differential mobilization of Fe and Mn, and CaSO<SUB>4</SUB>-vein formation in the Grasberg and Shoemaker formations.

A discrepancy exists between Mars climate models that do not predict winds this strong and observations that sand-sized particles are indeed moving. This paper describes how wind friction speeds well below &lt;fi&gt;u&lt;/fi&gt;<SUB>*tf</SUB>, but above the impact threshold, &lt;fi&gt;u&lt;/fi&gt;<SUB>*ti</SUB>, required to sustain saltation, can initiate sustained saltation on Mars, but at relatively low flux.

The passage of a saltation cluster should leave behind a narrow zone of affected surface grains. The cumulative effect of many clusters represents a low-flux phenomenon that should produce slow changes to aeolian bedforms over periods in which winds remain close to &lt;fi&gt;u&lt;/fi&gt;<SUB>*ti</SUB> and never or rarely reach &lt;fi&gt;u&lt;/fi&gt;<SUB>*tf</SUB>.

      "abstract": "Dust aerosol plays a fundamental role in the behavior and evolution of the martian atmosphere. The first five Mars years of Mars Exploration Rover data provide an unprecedented record of the dust load at two sites. This record is useful for characterization of the atmosphere at the sites and as ground truth for orbital observations. Atmospheric extinction optical depths have been derived from solar images after calibration and correction for time-varying dust that has accumulated on the camera windows. The record includes local, regional, and globally extensive dust storms. Comparison with contemporaneous thermal infrared data suggests significant variation in the size of the dust aerosols, with a 1 μm effective radius during northern summer and a 2 μm effective radius at the onset of a dust lifting event. The solar longitude (L<SUB>S</SUB>) 20-136° period is also characterized by the presence of cirriform clouds at the Opportunity site, especially near L<SUB>S</SUB> = 50° and 115°. In addition to water ice clouds, a water ice haze may also be present, and carbon dioxide clouds may be present early in the season. Variations in dust opacity are important to the energy balance of each site, and work with seasonal variations in insolation to control dust devil frequency at the Spirit site.",

In situ mapping of the petrographic, elemental, structural, and stratigraphic characteristics of outcrops and rocks distinguishes four mappable bedrock lithologic units. Three of these rock units predate the surrounding Burns formation sulfate-rich sandstones and one, the Matijevic Formation, represents conditions on early Mars predating the formation of Endeavour Crater. The stratigraphy assembled from these observations includes several geologic unconformities. The differences in lithologic units across these unconformities record changes in the character and intensity of the Martian aqueous environment over geologic time. Water circulated through fractures in the oldest rocks over periods long enough that texturally and elementally significant alteration occurred in fracture walls. These oldest pre-Endeavour rocks and their network of mineralized and altered fractures were preserved by burial beneath impact ejecta and were subsequently exhumed and exposed. The alteration along joints in the oldest rocks and the mineralized veins and concentrations of trace metals in overlying lithologic units is direct evidence that copious volumes of mineralized and/or hydrothermal fluids circulated through the early Martian crust. The wide range in intensity of structural and chemical modification from outcrop to outcrop along the crater rim shows that the ejecta of large (&gt;8 km in diameter) impact craters is complex. These results imply that geologic complexity is to be anticipated in other areas of Mars where cratering has been a fundamental process in the local and regional geology and mineralogy.",

Data retrieved from these images were modeled using radiative transfer theory to study the microphysical and surface scattering nature of materials at both sites. Nearly 57,000 individual measurements from 1900 images were collected of rock and soil units identified by their color and morphologic properties over a wide range of phase angles (0-150°). Images were acquired between Sols 500 and 1525 in the Columbia Hills and regions around Home Plate in Gusev Crater and in the plains and craters between Erebus and Victoria Craters in Meridiani Planum. Corrections for diffuse skylight incorporated sky models based on observations of atmospheric opacity throughout the mission. Disparity maps created from Pancam stereo images allowed estimates of local facet orientations. For Spirit, soils at lower elevations near Home Plate were modeled with lower single scattering albedo (w) values than those on the summit of Husband Hill, but otherwise soils exhibited similar scattering properties to previous Gusev soils. Dark ripple sands at the El Dorado dunes were among the most forward-scattering materials modeled. Silica-rich soils and nodules near Home Plate were analyzed for the first time, and exhibited increased forward scattering behavior with increasing wavelength, consistent with microporosity inferred from previous high resolution images and thermal infrared spectroscopy. For Opportunity, the opposition effect width parameter for sandstone outcrop rocks was modeled for the first time, and demonstrated average values consistent with surfaces of intermediate porosity and/or grain size distribution between those modeled for spherule-rich soils and darker, clast-poor soils. Soils outside a wind streak emanating from the northern rim of Victoria Crater exhibited w values ∼16% higher than soils inside the streak. Overall, w values and scattering properties for outcrop rocks, spherule-rich soils, and rover tracks were similar to previous Meridiani Planum analyses, emphasizing the homogeneity of these materials across nearly 12 km of rover odometry.",

Multispectral visible and near-infrared (VNIR) Pancam observations were used to characterize reflectance properties of rock units. Using spectral end-member detection and classification approaches including a principal components/n-dimensional visualization, automatic sequential maximum angle convex cone method, and classification through hierarchical clustering, six main spectral classes of rock surfaces were identified: light-toned veins, Grasberg fm., the smectite-bearing Matijevic formation, the hematitic \"blueberry\" spherules, resistant spherules within the Matijevic fm. dubbed \"newberries,\" and the Shoemaker formation impact breccia. Some of these could be divided into spectral subclasses. There were three types of veins: veins in the bench unit of Cape York, thinner veins in the Matijevic fm., and boxwork pattern-forming veins. The bench unit veins had higher 535 nm band depths than the other two vein subclasses and a steeper 934 to 1009 nm slope. The Grasberg fm. has VNIR spectral features that are interpreted to indicate higher fractions of red hematite than in the sulfate-bearing Burns Fm. The Matijevic fm. includes both light-toned, fine-grained matrix, and dark-toned veneers. The latter has a weak near-infrared absorption band centered near 950 nm consistent with nontronite. Observations of Rock Abrasion Tool brushed and ground newberries indicated that cuttings from the RAT grind had a longer wavelength reflectance maximum and deeper 535 nm band depth, consistent with more oxidized materials. Greater oxidation of cementing materials in the newberries is consistent with a diagenetic concretion origin.",

Bivariate and factor analyses define distinct textural groups at 51 sites along the traverse completed by the Spirit rover as it crossed the plains and went into the Columbia Hills. Fine-to-medium sand is ubiquitous in ripples and wind drifts. Most distributions show excess fine material, consistent with a predominance of wind erosion over the last 3.8 billion years. Negative skewness at West Valley is explained by the removal of fine sand during active erosion, or alternatively, by excess accumulation of coarse sand from a local source. The coarse to very coarse sand particles of ripple armors in the basaltic plains have a unique combination of size and shape. Their distribution display significant changes in their statistical moments within the ~400 m that separate the Columbia Memorial Station from Bonneville Crater. Results are consistent with aeolian and/or impact deposition, while the elongated and rounded shape of the grains forming the ripples, as well as their direction of origin, could point to Ma'adim Vallis as a possible source. For smaller particles on the traverse, our findings confirm that aeolian processes have dominated over impact and other processes to produce sands with the observed size and shape patterns across a spectrum of geologic (e.g., ripples and plains soils) and aerographic settings (e.g., wind shadows).",

Santa Maria crater is a relatively young impact crater, approximately 100 m in diameter and 11-17 m deep. Opportunity performed detailed analyses on several ejecta blocks and completed an extensive imaging campaign around the crater. Many of the ejecta blocks are composed of sandstone with abundant wind ripple laminations suggestive of eolian deposition. However, other ejecta blocks are massive, fine-grained, and exhibit a nodular texture. These rocks are interpreted to be the first rocks of a grain size smaller than the Microscopic Imager can resolve, and may represent the first mudstones observed by the rover. Several depositional environments are considered for the origin of the fine-grained rocks, and the observations are best fit by a transient evaporitic lake. If the inferred mudstones were deposited in a lacustrine setting, then surface water may have been present in a broader range of surface environments than previously documented at Meridiani Planum.",

They are capable of maintaining high RH in a closed environment and keeping an aqueous film at their grain surfaces. More importantly, their dehydration processes are much slower than H<SUB>2</SUB>O ice sublimation. Using the activation energy (Ea) of epsomite dehydration, derived experimentally at Mars relevant atmospheric pressure (P) and partial pressure of H<SUB>2</SUB>O (P<SUB>H2O</SUB>), we estimated the half-life (t<SUB>1/2</SUB>) of epsomite dehydration within a model predicted T range of subsurface sulfate-rich layer at Mars equator. We found that subsurface hydrous sulfates formed during past high obliquity periods (&gt;45°) have a high probability to maintain mid-to-high degrees of hydration even until the present epoch. This prediction based on experiments is consistent with an observation made by the Spirit rover at Gusev on Mars, and with a field observation at a hyperarid site on Tibet Plateau. Our study supports the hypothesis that subsurface hydrated sulfates are the major host for the high water-equivalent-hydrogen (WEH) values observed at two equatorial regions on Mars.",

We propose using built-in processing by the instrument itself for adaptive data collection, faster reconnaissance, and increased mission science yield. We have developed a machine learning pixel classifier that is sensitive to texture differences in surface materials, enabling more sophisticated onboard classification than was previously possible. This classifier can be implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for maximal efficiency and minimal impact on the rest of the system's functions.

The majority of the partial correlation coefficients between these data sets were not statistically significant. Restricting the targets to those that were abraded by the rock abrasion tool (RAT) led to improved Pearson’s correlations, most notably between the red-blue ratio (673 nm/434 nm) and Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>-bearing phases, but partial correlations were not statistically significant. Partial Least Squares (PLS) calculations relating Pancam 11-color visible to near-IR (VNIR; ∼400-1000 nm) “spectra” to APXS and Mössbauer element or mineral abundances showed generally poor performance, although the presence of compositional outliers led to improved PLS results for data from Meridiani. When the Meridiani PLS model for pyroxene was tested by predicting the pyroxene content of Gusev targets, the results were poor, indicating that the PLS models for Meridiani are not applicable to data from other sites. Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) classification of Gusev crater data showed mixed results. Of the 24 Gusev test regions of interest (ROIs) with known classes, 11 had &gt;30% of the pixels in the ROI classified correctly, while others were mis-classified or unclassified. k-Means clustering of APXS and Mössbauer data was used to assign Meridiani targets to compositional classes. The clustering-derived classes corresponded to meaningful geologic and/or color unit differences, and SIMCA classification using these classes was somewhat successful, with &gt;30% of pixels correctly classified in 9 of the 11 ROIs with known classes. <P />This work shows that the relationship between SWIR multispectral imaging data and APXS- and Mössbauer-derived composition/mineralogy is often weak, a perhaps not entirely unexpected result given the different surface sampling depths of SWIR imaging (uppermost few microns) vs. APXS (tens of μm) and MB measurements (hundreds of μm). Results from the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover’s ChemCam Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument may show a closer relationship to Mastcam SWIR multispectral observations, however, because the initial laser shots onto a target will analyze only the upper few micrometers of the surface. The clustering and classification methods used in this study can be applied to any data set to formalize the definition of classes and identify targets that do not fit in previously defined classes.",

Terrestrial analog field work at the Amboy lava field, Mojave Desert, California, included real-time wind measurements and assessments of active sediment deposition in four small (&lt;100 m) craters. Preliminary results indicate that reverse flow or stagnant wind flow likely occurs in craters with depth-to-diameter (d/D) ratios of ≥0.05. Measurements taken within a crater of d/D of ∼0.02 do not indicate reverse flow; therefore, reverse flow is expected to cease within a d/D ranging from 0.02 to 0.05, resulting in wind movement directly over the crater floor in the downwind direction. Craters with asymmetric eolian deposits near the Mars Spirit landing site have d/D from 0.034 to 0.076, suggesting that reverse flow occurs in these craters. Thus, the position of windblown sediments in the small craters on the northwest part of the floor would indicate prevailing winds from the northwest to the southeast at the time of deposition or redistribution.",

These DEM models were developed to improve interpretations of laboratory and in situ rover data, and can simulate complicated regolith conditions. A DEM simulation was created of a laboratory experiment that involved a MER wheel digging into lunar regolith simulant. Sinkage and torques measured in the experiment were compared with those predicted numerically using simulated particles of increasing shape complexity (spheres, ellipsoids, and poly-ellipsoids). GTSC simulations, using the same model regolith used in the MER simulations, indicate a peak friction angle of approximately 37–38° compared to internal friction angles of 36.5–37.7° determined from the wheel digging experiments. Density of the DEM regolith was 1820kg/m<SUP loc=\"post\">3</SUP> compared to 1660kg/m<SUP loc=\"post\">3</SUP> for the lunar simulant used in the wheel digging experiment indicating that the number of grain contacts and grain contact resistance determined bulk strength in the DEM simulations, not density. An improved correspondence of DEM and actual test regolith densities is needed to simulate the evolution of regolith properties as density changes.",

Examination of several dozen outcrops shows that Mars is geologically complex at meter length scales, the record of its geologic history is well exposed, stratigraphic units may be identified and correlated across significant areas on the ground, and outcrops and geologic relationships between materials may be analyzed with techniques commonly employed in terrestrial field geology. Despite their burial during the course of Martian geologic time by widespread epiclastic materials, mobile fines, and fall deposits, the selective exhumation of deep and well-preserved geologic units has exposed undisturbed outcrops, stratigraphic sections, and structural information much as they are preserved and exposed on Earth. A rich geologic record awaits skilled future field investigators on Mars. The correlation of ground observations and orbital images enables construction of a corresponding geologic reconnaissance map. Most of the outcrops visited are interpreted to be pyroclastic, impactite, and epiclastic deposits overlying an unexposed substrate, probably related to a modified Gusev crater central peak. Fluids have altered chemistry and mineralogy of these protoliths in degrees that vary substantially within the same map unit. Examination of the rocks exposed above and below the major unconformity between the plains lavas and the Columbia Hills directly confirms the general conclusion from remote sensing in previous studies over past years that the early history of Mars was a time of more intense deposition and modification of the surface. Although the availability of fluids and the chemical and mineral activity declined from this early period, significant later volcanism and fluid convection enabled additional, if localized, chemical activity.",

Specialized wheel-trenching sequences allowed analysis of wheel motor and suspension telemetry to determine regolith friction angle $\\phi$ and cohesion c at trench sites. Friction angles were 30°-37°, and cohesions were 0-2 kPa. Simpler wheel-scuff maneuvers were analyzed for cohesion by assuming the range of $\\phi$ determined from trenches; cohesions in wheel-scuffed regoliths were from 0 to 11 kPa. Regolith $\\phi$ and c can be related to regolith origins. Grain sorting, compaction, shape, size, and angularity influence $\\phi$. Impact cratering and aeolian processes have affected grain angularity and sorting of Martian regolith at both Mars Exploration Rover (MER) landing sites and contend in opposing ways to determine grain characteristics in the regolith. Friction angles are consistent with dry, rigid, nonplaty grains with particle size frequencies dominated by very fine sand (as seen by the Microscopic Imager or MI) with at least some grain rounding (unresolved by MI), reflecting physical weathering from aeolian saltation. Friction angle results from MER trenches therefore indicate that regolith states are between fully mature aeolian materials and impact debris. MI and color Pancam views show trench tailings and trench floors are redder, brighter, and have more intermixed extremely fine (unresolved) grains than regolith closer to the surface disturbed and exposed only by rolling tracks.",

      "abstract": "During 6 years of continuous operations on the Martian surface, the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit has covered a traverse of approximately 7 km from the landing point to its current position at “Troy” near Home Plate. Localization of Spirit (and Opportunity) has been performed using two different methods: one that employs an incremental bundle adjustment (IBA) using rover imagery, and one that compares image features common to both a rover orthoimage and an orbital orthoimage. The IBA method continuously yields the desired 3-D rover positions at a very high level of accuracy and provides a simultaneous solution for high-quality topographic mapping of neighborhoods surrounding the rover. On the other hand, high-resolution orbital imagery can verify rover positions wherever the rover track is visible. Rapid rover localization on the orbital orthoimage is often achieved by comparing a rover orthoimage to the orbital orthoimage. In this paper, we present research results from a systematic comparison of these two localization methods over the entire length of the Spirit traverse. Two orbital orthoimages were generated from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) imagery. Integration of Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data into the HiRISE digital elevation model (DEM) and orthoimage generation was performed and proved to be effective in reducing large inconsistencies between MOLA and HiRISE data. This study found an overall difference of 1.5 percent of the traversed distance between the two sets of traverse positions derived using the two different localization methods. After a geometric transformation from one traverse to the other, the remaining inconsistency then represents the local differences between them and can be reduced to a level of less than 0.15 percent. Discussions of error sources and the strength and weakness of the methods are given. Scientific applications of the localization data are also briefly introduced.",

Repeated Pancam multispectral observations have been acquired at four of these deposits to monitor spectral and textural changes over time during exposure to Martian surface conditions. Previous studies suggested that temporal spectral changes occur because of mineralogic changes (e.g., phase transitions accompanying dehydration). In this study, we present a multispectral and temporal analysis of eight Pancam image sequences at the Tyrone exposure, three at the Gertrude Weise exposure, two at the Kit Carson exposure, and ten at the Ulysses exposure that have been acquired as of sol 2132 (1 January 2010). We compare observed variations in Pancam data to spectral changes predicted by laboratory experiments for the dehydration of ferric sulfates. We also present a spectral analysis of repeated Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE observations spanning 32 sols and a textural analysis of Spirit Microscopic Imager observations of Ulysses spanning 102 sols. At all bright soil exposures, we observe no statistically significant spectral changes with time that are uniquely diagnostic of dehydration and/or mineralogic phase changes. However, at Kit Carson and Ulysses, we observe significant textural changes, including slumping within the wheel trench, movement of individual grains, disappearance of fines, and dispersal of soil clods. All observed textural changes are consistent with aeolian sorting and/or minor amounts of air fall dust deposition.",

These data provided clues to origin, transport mechanisms, association with geologic units, and other alteration processes. Clasts average 15 mm in size and 0.73 sphericity, and display a low degree of roundness; textures include vesicular, smooth and rough flat-faceted, and granular, platy clasts. Characteristics are comparable to those for clasts outside the “Home Plate” region. Mapped geologic units around “Home Plate” are characterized by distinctive clast morphologic parameters and only minor adjustments were made to unit boundaries and definitions mapped by others; no new units are suggested by the data. Consistent roundness values seen from unit to unit, coupled with the correlation between unit boundaries and clast characteristics in and outside “Home Plate,” indicate that no appreciable transport has occurred subsequent to fragmentation from outcrop and emplacement. Rather, clasts have been emplaced through volcanic activity and/or impact and have been subjected to weathering processes since that time. We interpret vesicular and flat-faceted clasts (texture types 1-3) to be derived from Mitcheltree ridge basalts and the presence of these clasts to provide a general outline of the original extent of this unit. Platy, granular-textured clasts (texture type 5) are derived from the upper Home Plate unit.",

The key chemical observation is greater homogeneity in fines relative to the other two, consistent with regional- and global-scale sampling of chemical compositions by finer particle sizes. The mix class is generally more heterogeneous as are samples from the Columbia Hills within each class. Variation in the trace element Ni is consistent with a CI contribution not exceeding 3%, while that of Ti is compatible with Fe-Ti oxide enrichment not exceeding 3%. Physical mixing models are poorly supported. Among many potential binary and three-component mixing models, only two show some consistency with the soil data: typical fines with the opaline Si end-member identified at Home Plate and typical fines with sulfates (bearing a variable mix of Ca, Fe, and Mg cations). We also infer that binary mixing transcends classes, contrasting strongly with terrestrial sediments, and that mixing trends are consistent with significant nonmixing contributions, perhaps including localized chemical alteration. The decoupling between chemistry and grain size classes also suggests that processes linking composition with grain size, such as heavy mineral sorting, may have been minimal or absent entirely. The primary exception to this is the correlation between Cl and Si, Cl-S, and Al-Si, which is strongest in the fines class.",

Their general characteristics are the same within factors of 2 among the seasons, with median diameters of 19 m in season one, 24 m in season two, and 39 m in season three, and dust flux values for individual vortices ranging from 4.0 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> to 4.6 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> in season one, 5.2 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> to 6.2 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> in season two, and 1.5 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> to 1.6 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> in season three. All three seasons were initiated with the onset of southern Martian spring within 14 sols of the same L<SUB>s</SUB> (181°) and their frequency increased to the period corresponding to late southern spring. The occurrences decreased monotonically in seasons one and three but apparently ended abruptly in season two when a large dust storm occurred; although the dusty atmosphere might have precluded the detection of active DDs, the abrupt cessation could result from conditions such as thermal stability of the atmosphere due to the presence of dust which could halt DD formation. Dust devils can contribute significant quantities of dust to the atmosphere, although it is unclear as to whether this dust stays locally or is injected into higher-altitude winds and is distributed elsewhere. In the three DD seasons observed through Spirit, DDs in Gusev Crater injected a minimum average of ∼18 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> kg of material into the atmosphere each season.",

To better understand the composition and evolution of Mars, we compare whole rock compositions of basaltic shergottitic meteorites and basaltic lavas examined by the Spirit Mars Exploration Rover in Gusev Crater. Concentrations range from K-poor (as low as 0.02 wt.% K <SUB>2</SUB>O) in the shergottites to K-rich (up to 1.2 wt.% K <SUB>2</SUB>O) in basalts from the Columbia Hills (CH) of Gusev Crater; the Adirondack basalts from the Gusev Plains have more intermediate concentrations of K <SUB>2</SUB>O (0.16 wt.% to below detection limit). The compositional dataset for the Gusev basalts is more limited than for the shergottites, but it includes the minor elements K, P, Ti, Cr, and Ni, whose behavior during mantle melting varies from very incompatible (prefers melt) to very compatible (remains in the residuum). The range in partitioning behavior of these elements provides leverage on interpreting igneous processes. Models are presented that demonstrate how concentrations of these elements in Gusev basaltic magmas would change by simple igneous processes (fractional crystallization, crustal contamination, and mantle partial melting). The Gusev basalts may be related by two-stage batch melting of a primitive (K-rich) mantle source to first, generate the K-rich, Columbia Hills basalts and second, the lower K Adirondack basalts, leaving behind a K-poor residuum. The mantle source for the Gusev basalts is separate from the more depleted (K-poorer) source region of the shergottites. This indicates that primitive, K-rich mantle persisted until the Early Hesperian during formation of the Columbia Hills basalts. We suggest that separate mantle reservoirs developed by inhomogeneous partial melting (at melt fractions greater than 0.05) to form the Martian crust in the first 1 Ga of the planet's history.",

Pressure profiles were obtained to assess the effect of nonerodible roughness elements on vortex structure at the surface. As roughness increased, vortex size increased and tangential velocity decreased. Particle threshold experimental results suggested that small increases in surface roughness enabled reduced threshold velocities to lift fine particles (&lt;100μm) from the surface. This “optimal roughness” or the amount of roughness necessary for enhancing sediment transport from the surface, could allow weaker dust devils to lift more material from the surface than otherwise possible. Sediment flux was calculated for different sediment sizes and densities to determine how surface roughness affects the lifting potential by dust devils. Sediment fluxes were similar to previous studies with bulk averages ranging from 10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 1 kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>, but they could be subdivided based on roughness. The results showed that for the low roughness case (λ ≈ 0.03), fluxes were at a maximum ranging from 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to 1 kg m<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> compared to two rougher surfaces (λ ≈ 0.11 and 0.23). For the lowest roughness density the airflow around the elements is enhanced, whereas the higher roughness values showed more loss of energy to the surface, impeding sediment transport similar to boundary layer studies examining roughness effects on sediment transport.",

      "abstract": "Laboratory simulations using the Arizona State University Vortex Generator (ASUVG) were run to simulate sediment flux in dust devils in terrestrial ambient and Mars-analog conditions. The objective of this study was to measure vortex sediment flux in the laboratory to yield estimations of natural dust devils on Earth and Mars, where all parameters may not be measured. These tests used particles ranging from 2 to 2000 μm in diameter and 1300 to 4800 kg m <SUP>-3</SUP> in density, and the results were compared with data from natural dust devils on Earth and Mars. Typically, the cores of dust devils (regardless of planetary environment) have a pressure decrease of ∼0.1-1.5% of ambient atmospheric pressure, which enhances the lifting of particles from the surface. Core pressure decreases in our experiments ranged from ∼0.01% to 5.00% of ambient pressure (10 mbar Mars cases and 1000 mbar for Earth cases) corresponding to a few tenths of a millibar for Mars cases and a few millibars for Earth cases. Sediment flux experiments were run at vortex tangential wind velocities of 1-45 m s <SUP>-1</SUP>, which typically correspond to ∼30-70% above vortex threshold values for the test particle sizes and densities. Sediment flux was determined by time-averaged measurements of mass loss for a given vortex size. Sediment fluxes of ∼10 <SUP>-6</SUP>-10 <SUP>0</SUP> kg m <SUP>-2</SUP> s <SUP>-1</SUP> were obtained, similar to estimates and measurements for fluxes in dust devils on Earth and Mars. Sediment flux is closely related to the vortex intensity, which depends on the strength of the pressure decrease in the core (Δ P). This study found vortex size is less important for lifting materials because many different diameters can have the same Δ P. This finding is critical in scaling the laboratory results to natural dust devils that can be several orders of magnitude larger than the laboratory counterparts.",

      "abstract": "The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit has discovered surprisingly high concentrations of amorphous silica in soil and nodular outcrops in the Inner Basin of the Columbia Hills. In Pancam multispectral observations, we find that an absorption feature at the longest Pancam wavelength (1009 nm) appears to be characteristic of these silica-rich materials; however, spectral analyses of amorphous silica suggest that the ∼1009 nm spectral feature is not a direct reflection of their silica-rich nature. Based on comparisons with spectral databases, we hypothesize that the presence of H <SUB>2</SUB>O or OH, either free (as water ice), adsorbed or bound in a mineral structure, is responsible for the spectral feature observed by Pancam. The Gertrude Weise soil, which is nearly pure opaline silica, may have adsorbed water cold-trapped on mineral grains. The origin of the ∼1009 nm Pancam feature observed in the silica-rich nodular outcrops may result from the presence of additional hydrated minerals (specific sulfates, halides, chlorides, sodium silicates, carbonates or borates). Using the ∼1009 nm feature with other spectral parameters as a \"hydration signature\" we have mapped the occurrence of hydrated materials along the extent of Spirit's traverse across the Columbia Hills from West Spur to Home Plate (sols 155-1696). We have also mapped this hydration signature across large panoramic images to understand the regional distribution of materials that are spectrally similar to the silica-rich soil and nodular outcrops. Our results suggest that hydrated materials are common in the Columbia Hills.",

      "abstract": "Volcanism has been a major process during most of the geologic history of Mars. Based on data collected from terrestrial basaltic eruptions, we assume that the volatile content of martian lavas was typically ∼0.5 wt.% water, ∼0.7 wt.% carbon dioxide, ∼0.14 wt.% sulfur dioxide, and contained several other important volatile constituents. From the geologic record of volcanism on Mars we find that during the late Noachian and through the Amazonian volcanic degassing contributed ∼0.8 bar to the martian atmosphere. Because most of the outgassing consisted of greenhouse gases (i.e., CO <SUB>2</SUB> and SO <SUB>2</SUB>) warmer surface temperatures resulting from volcanic eruptions may have been possible. Our estimates suggest that ∼1.1 × 10 <SUP>21</SUP> g (∼8 ± 1 m m <SUP>-2</SUP>) of juvenile water were released by volcanism; slightly more than half the amount contained in the north polar cap and atmosphere. Estimates for released CO <SUB>2</SUB> (1.6 × 10 <SUP>21</SUP> g) suggests that a large reservoir of carbon dioxide is adsorbed in the martian regolith or alternatively ∼300 cm cm <SUP>-2</SUP> of carbonates may have formed, although these materials would not occur readily in the presence of excess SO <SUB>2</SUB>. Up to ∼120 cm cm <SUP>-2</SUP> (2.2 × 10 <SUP>20</SUP> g) of acid rain (H <SUB>2</SUB>SO <SUB>4</SUB>) may have precipitated onto the martian surface as the result of SO <SUB>2</SUB> degassing. The hydrogen flux resulting from volcanic outgassing may help explain the martian atmospheric D/ H ratio. The amount of outgassed nitrogen (∼1.3 mbar) may also be capable of explaining the martian atmospheric <SUP>15</SUP>N/ <SUP>14</SUP>N ratio. Minor gas constituents (HF, HCl, and H <SUB>2</SUB>S) could have formed hydroxyl salts on the surface resulting in the physical weathering of geologic materials. The amount of hydrogen fluoride emitted (1.82 × 10 <SUP>18</SUP> g) could be capable of dissolving a global layer of quartz sand ∼5 mm thick, possibly explaining why this mineral has not been positively identified in spectral observations. The estimates of volcanic outgassing presented here will be useful in understanding how the martian atmosphere evolved over time.",

      "abstract": "Gossan samples collected during a reconnaissance expedition to High Lake in Nunavut, Canada, were analyzed to determine their mineral components and to define parameters for the geochemical environment in which they formed. The gossan represents a natural acid drainage site in an arctic environment that serves as an analogue to the conditions under which sulfate and Fe-oxide possibly formed on Mars. Rock and soil samples were taken from three different outcrops and analyzed using XRD, SEM/EDS and Mössbauer. Two main mineral assemblages were observed. The first assemblage, which was found primarily in samples from the first outcrop, contained chlorite, Fe-phosphates, Fe-oxide and quartz. The second assemblage, which was found at the second and third outcrops, was primarily quartz, mica and jarosite. One sample (G41), containing Fe-oxide, jarosite and gypsum, appears to be transitional between a Fe-oxide dominant assemblage to a jarosite dominant assemblage. Thermodynamic equilibria predicts that the gossan pore water should range from mildly acidic, relatively sulfate-poor (pH 3-6; SO <SUB>4</SUB> &lt;1000 mg l <SUP>-1</SUP>) to highly acidic and relatively sulfate-rich (pH 0.5-3; SO <SUB>4</SUB> &gt;3000 mg l <SUP>-1</SUP>) for the first and second mineral assemblages, respectively. Kinetic reaction models indicate that the second assemblage replaces the first during evaporation or freezing of water. Compared to acid mine drainage (AMD) sites located in temperate regions, the arctic High Lake gossan lacks diversity in sulfate species and has smaller diagenetic crystal sizes. The smaller crystal size may reflect the slower reaction rates at colder temperatures and the seasonal water saturation. These initial results indicate that the High Lake gossan deposit does record mechanisms for which minerals like hematite, goethite, gypsum and jarosite, which are found on Mars, can form in an environment that involves seasonal water occurrence in a cold climate.",

We used rover-inspired methods of remote hand lens-scale data acquisition to conduct reconnaissance of a well-characterized Martian analog field site. The objective was to determine if the current methodologies associated with the use of remote hand lens-scale imagers maximizes science return. Field geologists provided with hand lens-scale images of targets in geologic context could correctly identify many important characteristics of those targets. However, they could not fully confirm or rule out any formation hypothesis using the data provided solely through rover-driven observational strategies. This was due to (1) a lack of “intermediate-scale,” or millimeter- to centimeter-scale images providing important contextual information for the targets studied and (2) the limited number of hand lens-scale images that were taken using rover-driven methodology. We conclude that the benefits of the hand lens as an effective triage tool and discriminator of microtexture are limited using current rover-driven methodology because the hand lens-type imager is not deployed frequently, and resulting data cannot be used to fully support geochemical observations. We recommend pursuing ways to increase the number of images that can reasonably be acquired at the hand lens scale. In order for hand lens-scale imaging to be fully effective, textural characteristics diagnostic of the nature of a geologic site need to be identifiable at a number of different resolutions; rover microscale observational strategies must include more contextual imaging.",

Pyroxene and magnetite dominate the east side, while olivine, nanophase Fe oxide (npOx) and glass are more abundant on the western side. Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) observations reveal that eastern Home Plate has higher Si/Mg, Al, Zn, Ni, and K, while Cl and Br are higher in the west.

Among them are Wishstone Class tephrites with unusually high P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> (&gt;5 wt %) abundances. To obtain the chemical compositions of rock interiors, we extrapolated a trend defined by brushed and abraded surface compositions. The extrapolation analysis suggests the high-P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> tephrite signature is not attributable to secondary aqueous alteration but represents an igneous rock composition. Assessment of the compositional trend also suggests that merrillite is the phosphate mineral in Wishstone Class. Modified CIPW norm calculations using merrillite instead of apatite show that Wishstone Class rocks are silica saturated (hypersthene-olivine normative) and alkaline. The high-P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> whole rock compositions plot above solubility curves of merrillite in a diagram of P<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>5</SUB> versus aluminosity, suggesting that mechanical admixture of merrillite is required. A source supplying merrillite cannot be a common silicate magma; instead, it could be a carbonatitic melt or a highly fractionated residual melt (jotunite) after anorthosite crystallization. Comparison with Earth analogs suggests that the Wishstone Class is akin to alkaline basalts in the eastern Snake River Plain, with regard to its chemistry, texture, and geologic context. These alkaline basalts are interpreted to originate from mantle metasomatized by CO<SUB>2</SUB>-fluids and highly alkaline melts in the wake of the Yellowstone hot spot. Thus, we propose that the Wishstone Class represents a silica-saturated alkaline suite that has mechanically mixed xenocrystic merrillites, probably during explosive volcanic eruption; the merrillites crystallized from carbonate-rich magma produced by melting of a CO<SUB>2</SUB>-bearing Martian mantle.",

The best MIR match is a tephra that has a strong plagioclase feldspar transparency feature and was altered under dry, high-temperature, oxidizing conditions. This sample is not a VNIR analog and is not a process analog, but it emphasizes the mineralogical importance of plagioclase feldspar in Martian dust.

Variation in particle morphologic parameters along traverse is consistent with crossing mapped geologic unit boundaries. Texture is divided into four types: vesicular, smooth and flat-faceted, rough and flat-faceted, and very rough. Sphericity and roundness are intermediate and low, respectively, comparable to particles moved by high-energy transport or to crushed particles. This indicates intermittent, high-energy emplacement or modification of a single lithology, rather than systematic, continuous low-energy abrasion or wear over time. Comparison with particle morphology at other Mars landing sites is consistent with the hypothesis that no secondary systematic transport or wide-scale chemical alteration was active at a significant enough level to alter macromorphology. In particular, particle morphology at the Mars Pathfinder site shows stronger evidence of abrasion than along the Spirit traverse, suggesting Mars Pathfinder particles have undergone abrasion processes that particles in this study area have not. Additionally, morphology indices have correlation coefficients near zero, indicating that a fluvial transport mechanism is likely not responsible for morphology. Morphology and texture are instead related to origin and composition rather than subsequent modification. Morphology and texture support a volcanic origin, possibly without modification, but most likely altered primarily by ballistic impact, implying that the Spirit landing site and traverse may be utilized in the future as a standard site for characterization of impact-derived morphology.",

Basalt and olivine basalt outcrops are found at and near Home Plate, a putative hydrovolcanic structure. At least three pyroxene compositions are indicated by MB data. MB spectra of outcrops Barnhill and Torquas resemble palagonitic material and thus possible supergene aqueous alteration. Deposits of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>-sulfate soil, located at Paso Robles, Arad, and Tyrone, are likely products of acid sulfate fumarolic and/or hydrothermal activity, possibly in connection with Home Plate volcanism. Hematite-rich outcrops between Home Plate and Tyrone (e.g., Montalva) may also be products of this aqueous activity. Low water-to-rock ratios (isochemical alteration) are implied during palagonite, goethite, and hematite formation because bulk chemical compositions are basaltic (SO<SUB>3</SUB>-free basis). High water-to-rock ratios (leaching) under acid sulfate conditions are implied for the high-SiO<SUB>2</SUB> rock and soil in Eastern Valley and the float rock FuzzySmith, which has possible pyrite/marcasite as a hydrothermal alteration product.",

We present data acquired by the Spirit Mars Exploration Rover by Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS), Mössbauer Spectrometer, Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), and Panoramic Camera (Pancam) for the Barnhill class rocks and nearby vesicular Irvine class basalts. In major element concentrations (e.g., SiO<SUB>2</SUB>, Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, MgO, and FeO*), the two rock classes are similar, suggesting that they are derived from a similar magmatic source. The Barnhill class, however, has higher abundances of Cl, Br, Zn, and Ge with comparable SO<SUB>3</SUB> to the Irvine basalts. Nanophase ferric oxide (np ox) and volcanic glass were detected in the Barnhill class rocks by Mössbauer and Mini-TES, respectively, and imply greater alteration and cooling rates in the Barnhill than in the Irvine class rocks. The high volatile elements in the Barnhill class agree with volcanic textures that imply interaction with a briny groundwater during eruption and (or) by later alteration. Differences in composition between the Barnhill and Irvine classes allow the fingerprinting of a Na-Mg-Zn-Ge-Cl-Br (+/-Fe +/- Ca +/- CO<SUB>2</SUB>) brine with low S. Nearby sulfate salt soils of fumarolic origin may reflect fractionation of an acidic S-rich vapor during boiling of a hydrothermal brine at depth.

Outcrops measured on West Spur are conformable in strike with shallower dips (7-15°) than observed on Husband Hill. Dips are consistent with observed strata draping the Columbia Hills. Initial uplift was likely related either to the formation of the Gusev Crater central peak or ring or through mutual interference of overlapping crater rims. Uplift was followed by subsequent draping by a series of impact and volcaniclastic materials that experienced temporally and spatially variable aqueous infiltration, cementation, and alteration episodically during or after deposition. West Spur likely represents a spatially isolated depositional event. Erosion by a variety of processes, including mass wasting, removed tens of meters of materials and formed the Tennessee Valley primarily after deposition. This was followed by eruption of the Adirondack-class plains basalt lava flows which embayed the Columbia Hills. Minor erosion, impact, and aeolian processes have subsequently modified the Columbia Hills.",

Strong regional wind events endured by Spirit caused perceptible migration of ripple crests in deposits SSE of El Dorado, erasure of tracks in sandy areas, and changes to dust mantling the site. Localized thermal vortices swept across El Dorado, leaving paths of reduced dust but without perceptibly damaging nearly cohesionless sandy ripple crests. From orbit, winds responsible for frequently raising clay-sized dust into the atmosphere do not seem to significantly affect dunes composed of (more easily entrained) sand-sized particles, a long-standing paradox. This disparity between dust mobilization and sand mobilization on Mars is due largely to two factors: (1) dust occurs on the surface as fragile, low-density, sand-sized aggregates that are easily entrained and disrupted, compared with clay-sized air fall particles; and (2) induration of regolith is pervasive. Light-toned bed forms investigated at Gusev are coarse-grained ripples, an interpretation we propose for many of the smallest linear, light-toned bed forms of uncertain origin seen in high-resolution orbital images across Mars. On Earth, wind can organize bimodal or poorly sorted loose sediment into coarse-grained ripples. Coarse-grained ripples could be relatively common on Mars because development of durable, well-sorted sediments analogous to terrestrial aeolian quartz sand deposits is restricted by the lack of free quartz and limited hydraulic sediment processing.",

The chemistry of submillimeter thick, buff-colored veneers reflects multiple processes at work since the establishment of the current plains surface. Veneer composition is dominated by the mixing of silicate-rich dust and sulfate-rich outcrop surface, but it has also been influenced by mineral precipitation, including NaCl, and possibly by limited physical or chemical weathering of sulfate minerals. Competing processes of chemical alteration (perhaps mediated by thin films of water or water vapor beneath blanketing soils) and sandblasting of exposed outcrop surfaces determine the current distribution of veneers. Dark-toned rinds several millimeters thick reflect more extensive surface alteration but also indicate combined dust admixture, halite precipitation, and possible minor sulfate removal. Cemented fracture fills that are differentially resistant to erosion occur along the margins of linear fracture systems possibly related to impact. These appear to reflect limited groundwater activity along the margins of fractures, cementing mechanically introduced fill derived principally from outcrop rocks. The limited thickness and spatial distribution of these three features suggest that aqueous activity has been rare and transient or has operated at exceedingly low rates during the protracted interval since outcropping Meridiani strata were exposed on the plains surface.",

Results of this work show that the sand is olivine basaltic in composition, with minor amounts of sulfate and a high-silica phase (glass or secondary amorphous silica). Measurements from all three instruments indicate that pyroxene is twice as abundant as olivine, and that the pyroxene composition is dominated by the low-calcium variety. The volume abundance of olivine is constrained to be 10-15%. Results from detailed analyses of MER data are used to ground truth the spectral emissivity and mineral abundances derived from orbit with Mars Global Surveyor TES data. TES-derived mineral abundances are within 5% of those derived from MER data, which is generally within the statistical errors associated with TES-derived phase abundances. The agreement lends support to global- and regional-scale variations in mineralogical composition determined from TES data in previous studies. An alternative method of least squares minimization is used for modeling the TES and Mini-TES data; the benefits of this method are demonstrated by comparison with conventional least squares techniques previously used by TES data users.",

We include estimated bolometric albedo values of individual surface features (e.g., outcrops, dusty plains, aeolian bed forms, wheel tracks, light-toned soils, and crater walls) as well as overall surface averages of the 43 total panoramic albedo data sets acquired to date. We also present comparisons to estimated Lambert albedo values taken from the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) along the rovers' traverses, and to the large-scale bolometric albedos of the sites from the Viking Orbiter Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) and Mars Global Surveyor/Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES). The ranges of Pancam-derived albedos at Gusev Crater (0.14 to 0.25) and in Meridiani Planum (0.10 to 0.18) are in good agreement with IRTM, TES, and MOC orbital measurements. These data sets will be a useful tool and benchmark for future investigations of albedo variations with time, including measurements from orbital instruments like the Context Camera and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Long-term, accurate albedo measurements could also be important for future efforts in climate modeling as well as for studies of active surface processes.",

      "abstract": "Asteroid (16) Psyche is theorized to be an exposed iron core of a primordial asteroid and is the target of the upcoming NASA Psyche mission. Recent observations of Psyche identified the presence of rotational heterogeneity, a fine-grained regolith, pyroxene, and hydrated minerals on its surface. We obtained rotationally resolved mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy of Psyche with the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy to explore its compositional heterogeneity and to assess its mineralogy. We used a thermophysical model of Psyche to estimate and remove its thermal flux at the time of observation to obtain emissivity spectra at 14 different epochs in its rotation. We find that the MIR emissivity does not vary significantly over the rotation of the asteroid, though this may be due to similar aspect angles. We find a lack of mineralogical features, which could suggest that materials on Psyche in the region we observed are not infrared active and consistent with a metal or oxide surface. Differences between the presented spectra and previous studies might indicate a hemispherical compositional dichotomy.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarizes the evidence for the optical effects of space weathering, as well as the properties of the surface that control optical changes, on asteroid (101955) Bennu. First, we set the stage by briefly reviewing what was known about space weathering of low-albedo materials from telescopic surveys, laboratory simulations, and sample return analysis. We then look at the evidence for the nature of space weathering on Bennu from recent spacecraft imaging and spectroscopy observations, including the visible to near-infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths, followed by other measurements such as normal albedo measurements from LIDAR scans. We synthesize these different lines of evidence in an effort to describe a general model of space weathering processes and resulting color effects on dark C-complex asteroids, with hypotheses that can be tested by analyzing samples returned by the mission. <P />A working hypothesis that synthesizes findings thus far is that the optical effects of maturation in the space environment depend on the level of hydration of the silicate/phyllosilicate substrate. Subsequent variations in color depend on surface processes and exposure age. On strongly hydrated Bennu, in color imaging data, very young craters are darker and redder than their surroundings (more positive spectral slope in the wavelength range 0.4-0.7 μm) as a result of their smaller particle sizes and/or fresh exposures of organics by impacts. Solar wind, dehydration, or migration of fines may cause intermediate-age surfaces to appear bluer than the very young craters. Exposed surfaces evolve toward Bennu's moderately blue global average spectral slope. However, in spectroscopic and LIDAR data, the equator, the oldest surface on Bennu, is darker and redder (wavelength range 0.55-2.0 μm) than average and has shallower absorption bands, possibly due to dehydration and/or nanophase and/or microphase opaque production. <P />Bennu is a rubble pile with an active surface, making age relationships, which are critical for determining space weathering signals, difficult to locate and quantify. Hence, the full story ultimately awaits analyses of the Bennu samples that will soon be delivered to Earth.",

One group (\"sharp types,\" or STs, with band centers &lt;3 μm) has a spectral shape consistent with carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, while the other group (\"not sharp types,\" or NSTs, with bands centered &gt;3 μm) is not represented in the meteorite literature but is as abundant as the STs among large objects. Both groups are present in most low-albedo asteroid taxonomic classes, and, except in limited cases, taxonomic classifications based on 0.5-2.5 μm data alone cannot predict whether an asteroid is an ST or NST. Statistical tests show that the STs and NSTs differ in average band depth, semimajor axis, and perihelion at confidence levels ≥98% while not showing significant differences in albedo. We also show that many NSTs have a 3 μm absorption band shape like comet 67P and likely represent an important small-body composition throughout the solar system. A simple explanation for the origin of these groups is formation on opposite sides of the ammonia snow line, with the NST group accreting H<SUB>2</SUB>O and NH<SUB>3</SUB> and the ST group only accreting H<SUB>2</SUB>O, with subsequent thermal and chemical evolution resulting in the minerals seen today. Such an explanation is consistent with recent dynamical modeling of planetesimal formation and delivery and suggests that much more outer solar system material was delivered to the main asteroid belt than would be thought based on the number of D-class asteroids found today.",

Mean water abundances detected are about 250 μg/g over that of a mare reference surface at Mare Fecunditatis. Water abundances are locally anticorrelated with temperature. The distribution of water is consistent with derivation of water from pre-existing hydroxyl subsequently trapped in impact glass, provided hydroxyl increases with latitude as some models and measurements suggest. The detected water cannot be in equilibrium with the exosphere because insufficient water is present in the exosphere to maintain the surface abundance. The data are consistent with a high latitude water-bearing mineral host that may be a precursor to recently detected high latitude hematite.",

      "abstract": "Context. The store of data collected in public astronomical archives across the world is continuously expanding and, thus, providing a convenient interface for accessing this information is a major concern for ensuring a second life for the data. In this context, Solar System objects (SSOs) are often difficult or even impossible to query, owing to their ever-changing sky coordinates. <BR /> Aims: Our study is aimed at providing the scientific community with a search service for all potential detections of SSOs among the ESA astronomy archival imaging data, called the Solar System Object Search Service (SSOSS). We illustrate its functionalities using the case of asteroid (16) Psyche, for which no information in the far-IR (70-500 μm) has previously been reported, to derive its thermal properties in preparation for the upcoming NASA Psyche mission. <BR /> Methods: We performed a geometrical cross-match of the orbital path of each object, as seen by the satellite reference frame, with respect to the public high-level imaging footprints stored in the ESA archives. There are about 800 000 asteroids and 2000 comets included in the SSOSS, available through ESASky, providing both targeted and serendipitous observations. For this first release, three missions were chosen: XMM-Newton, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Herschel. <BR /> Results: We present a catalog listing all potential detections of asteroids within estimated limiting magnitude or flux limit in Herschel, XMM-Newton, and HST archival imaging data, including 909 serendipitous detections in Herschel images, 985 in XMM-Newton Optical Monitor camera images, and over 32 000 potential serendipitous detections in HST images. We also present a case study: the analysis of the thermal properties of Psyche from four serendipitous Herschel detections, combined with previously published thermal IR measurements. We see strong evidence for an unusual drop in (hemispherical spectral) emissivity, from 0.9 at 100 μm down to about 0.6 at 350 μm, followed by a possible but not well-constrained increase towards 500 μm, comparable to what was found for Vesta. The combined thermal data set puts a strong constraint on Psyche's thermal inertia (between 20 to 80 J m<SUP>‒2</SUP> s<SUP>‒1/2</SUP> K<SUP>‒1</SUP>) and favors an intermediate to low level surface roughness (below 0.4 for the rms of surface slopes). <BR /> Conclusions: Using the example of Psyche, we show how the SSOSS provides fast access to observations of SSOs from the ESA astronomical archives, regardless of whether the particular object was the actual target. This greatly simplifies the task of searching, identifying and retrieving such data for scientific analysis. <P />The catalog is also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/\">cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/659/A38\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/659/A38</A>",

Our shape model has dimensions 278 (-4/+8 km) × 238(-4/+6 km) × 171 km (-1/+5 km), an effective spherical diameter D<SUB>eff</SUB> = 222-1/+4 km, and a spin axis (ecliptic lon, lat) of (36°, -8°) ± 2°. We survey all the features previously reported to exist, tentatively identify several new features, and produce a global map of Psyche. Using 30 calibrated radar echoes, we find Psyche's overall radar albedo to be 0.34 ± 0.08 suggesting that the upper meter of regolith has a significant metal (i.e., Fe-Ni) content. We find four regions of enhanced or complex radar albedo, one of which correlates well with a previously identified feature on Psyche, and all of which appear to correlate with patches of relatively high optical albedo. Based on these findings, we cannot rule out a model of Psyche as a remnant core, but our preferred interpretation is that Psyche is a differentiated world with a regolith composition analogous to enstatite or CH/CB chondrites and peppered with localized regions of high metal concentrations. The most credible formation mechanism for these regions is ferrovolcanism as proposed by Johnson et al. (2020).",

Observations of two such asteroids by Hayabusa2 and Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) suggest a relationship between these bodies and CI, CM, and CY chondrites. To confirm this, meteorite spectra need to be collected under appropriate conditions for comparison with asteroid observations. We report midinfrared (MIR) emissivity spectra (5.5-50 μm) obtained under ambient and simulated asteroid environment conditions and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra (2-5 μm) of CM and CY chondrite fine-particulate (&lt;35 μm) powders for which bulk mineralogy was determined using X-ray diffraction. Reflectance spectra show a 3 μm feature associated with -OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O that shifts from shorter (∼2.72 μm) to longer (∼2.90 μm) wavelengths and develops a rounder shape and reduced band area with increasing thermal metamorphism. In the MIR, the transparency feature (TF) and features in the Si-O bending region (&gt;15 μm) can be used to infer the relative degree of aqueous alteration, and to resolve the effects of aqueous and thermal alteration, when combined with NIR spectral parameters. The MIR spectra of metamorphosed CY chondrites are distinct from CM chondrite spectra, including a plateau around the Christiansen feature (∼8.00-12.50 μm) and features at longer wavelengths in the Si-O bending region (e.g., ∼25.50 μm compared to ∼24.30 μm in the CM spectra). We additionally report potential implications of the spectra and parameters determined in this study for the results from Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx.",

We observed the asteroid at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (170-310 nm) using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope during two separate observations. We report that the spectrum is very red in the UV, with a blue upturn shortward of ∼200 nm. We find an absorption feature at 250 nm and a weaker absorption feature at 275 nm that may be attributed to a metal-oxide charge transfer band. We find that the red-sloped, relatively featureless spectrum of (16) Psyche is best matched with the reflectance spectrum of pure iron; however, our intimate mixture models show that small grains of iron may dominate the reflectance spectrum even if iron only comprises up to 10% of the material on the surface. We also stress that there is a limited database of reflectances for planetary surface analogs at UV wavelengths for comparison with the spectrum of (16) Psyche. The mid- and far-UV spectra (&lt;240 nm) are markedly different for each of the four asteroids observed at these wavelengths so far, including ones in the same spectral class, indicating that UV observations of asteroids could be used to better understand differences in the composition and processing of the surfaces of these small bodies.",

Meanwhile, the spectral character of olivine in the \"cross-over\" region of the infrared (4-8 μm) remains generally unexplored. We examine the relationship between olivine Mg# (molar Mg/[Mg + Fe] × 100) and the wavelength positions of two strong, discrete overtone-combination bands at ~5.6 and ~6.0 μm. In reflectance and thermal emission spectra measured for 47 synthetic and natural olivine samples that span the Mg-Fe solid solution, we find that the 5.6 and 6.0 μm bands shift systematically to longer wavelengths by 0.11 and 0.10 μm, respectively, with increasing Fe content. Our results indicate that olivine Mg# may be determined within ±10 mol% forsterite using the positions of these two bands, making \"cross-over\" region spectroscopy a potentially powerful remote sensing tool.",

      "abstract": "The asteroid belt is characterized by an extreme low total mass of material on dynamically excited orbits. The Nice model explains many peculiar qualities of the Solar system, including the belt's excited state, by invoking an orbital instability between the outer planets. However, previous studies of the Nice model's effect on the belt's structure struggle to reproduce the innermost asteroids' orbital inclination distribution. Here, we show how the final phase of giant planet migration sculpts the asteroid belt, in particular its inclination distribution. As interactions with leftover planetesimals cause Saturn to move away from Jupiter, its rate of orbital precession slows as the two planets' mutual interactions weaken. When the planets approach their modern separation, where Jupiter completes just short of five orbits for every two of Saturn's, Jupiter's eccentric forcing on Saturn strengthens. We use numerical simulations to show that the absence of asteroids with orbits that precess between 24 and 28 arcsec yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is related to the inclination problem. As Saturn's precession speeds back up, high-inclination asteroids are excited on to planet crossing orbits and removed from the inner main belt. Through this process, the asteroid belt's orbital structure is reshaped, leading to markedly improved simulation outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Context. The bulk density of an asteroid informs us about its interior structure and composition. To constrain the bulk density, one needs an estimated mass of the asteroid. The mass is estimated by analyzing an asteroid's gravitational interaction with another object, such as another asteroid during a close encounter. An estimate for the mass has typically been obtained with linearized least-squares methods, despite the fact that this family of methods is not able to properly describe non-Gaussian parameter distributions. In addition, the uncertainties reported for asteroid masses in the literature are sometimes inconsistent with each other and are suspected to be unrealistically low. <BR /> Aims: We aim to present a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the asteroid mass estimation problem based on asteroid-asteroid close encounters. We verify that our algorithm works correctly by applying it to synthetic data sets. We use astrometry available through the Minor Planet Center to estimate masses for a select few example cases and compare our results with results reported in the literature. <BR /> Methods: Our mass-estimation method is based on the robust adaptive Metropolis algorithm that has been implemented into the OpenOrb asteroid orbit computation software. Our method has the built-in capability to analyze multiple perturbing asteroids and test asteroids simultaneously. <BR /> Results: We find that our mass estimates for the synthetic data sets are fully consistent with the ground truth. The nominal masses for real example cases typically agree with the literature but tend to have greater uncertainties than what is reported in recent literature. Possible reasons for this include different astrometric data sets and weights, different test asteroids, different force models or different algorithms. For (16) Psyche, the target of NASA's Psyche mission, our maximum likelihood mass is approximately 55% of what is reported in the literature. Such a low mass would imply that the bulk density is significantly lower than previously expected and thus disagrees with the theory of (16) Psyche being the metallic core of a protoplanet. We do, however, note that masses reported in recent literature remain within our 3-sigma limits. <BR /> Results: The new MCMC mass-estimation algorithm performs as expected, but a rigorous comparison with results from a least-squares algorithm with the exact same data set remains to be done. The matters of uncertainties in comparison with other algorithms and correlations of observations also warrant further investigation.",

      "abstract": "The valence of iron has been used in terrestrial studies to trace the hydrolysis of primary silicate rocks. Here, we use a similar approach to characterize the secondary processes, namely thermal metamorphism and aqueous alteration, that have affected carbonaceous chondrites. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy at the Fe-K-edge was performed on a series of 36 CM, 9 CR, 10 CV, and 2 CI chondrites. While previous studies have focused on the relative distribution of Fe<SUP>0</SUP> with respect to oxidized iron (Fe<SUB>ox</SUB> = Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> + Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>) or the iron distribution in some specific phases (e.g., Urey-Craig diagram; Urey and Craig 1953), our measurements enable us to assess the fractions of iron in each of its three oxidation states: Fe<SUP>0</SUP>, Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>, and Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>. Among the four carbonaceous chondrites groups studied, a correlation between the iron oxidation index (IOI = [2(Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>) + 3(Fe<SUP>3+</SUP>)]/[Fe<SUB>TOT</SUB>]) and the hydrogen content is observed. However, within the CM group, for which a progressive alteration sequence has been defined, a conversion of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> to Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> is observed with increasing degree of aqueous alteration. This reduction of iron can be explained by an evolution in the mineralogy of the secondary phases. In the case of the few CM chondrites that experienced some thermal metamorphism, in addition to aqueous alteration, a redox memory of the aqueous alteration is present: a significant fraction of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> is present, together with Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> and sometimes Fe<SUP>0</SUP>. From our data set, the CR chondrites show a wider range of IOI from 1.5 to 2.5. In all considered CR chondrites, the three oxidation states of iron coexist. Even in the least-altered CR chondrites, the fraction of Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> can be high (30% for MET 00426). This observation confirms that oxidized iron has been integrated during formation of fine-grained amorphous material in the matrix (Le Guillou and Brearley 2014; Le Guillou et al. 2015; Hopp and Vollmer 2018). Last, the IOI of CV chondrites does not reflect the reduced/oxidized classification based on metal and magnetite proportions, but is strongly correlated with petrographic types. The valence of iron in CV chondrites therefore appears to be most closely related to thermal history, rather than aqueous alteration, even if these processes can occur together (Krot et al. 2004; Brearley and Krot 2013).",

It may be a remnant protoplanet that has been stripped of most silicates by a hit-and-run collision. Because Psyche offers insight into the planetary formation process, it is the target of NASA's Psyche mission, set to launch in 2023. In order to constrain Psyche's surface properties, we have carried out a mid-infrared (5-14 μm) spectroscopic study using data collected with the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph. Our study includes two observations covering different rotational phases. Using thermophysical modeling, we find that Psyche's surface is smooth and likely has a thermal inertia Γ = 5-25 J/m<SUP>2</SUP>/K/s<SUP>1/2</SUP> and bolometric emissivity ɛ = 0.9, although a scenario with ɛ = 0.7 and thermal inertia up to 95 J/m<SUP>2</SUP>/K/s<SUP>1/2</SUP> is possible if Psyche is somewhat larger than previously determined. The smooth surface is consistent with the presence of a metallic bedrock, which would be more ductile than silicate bedrock, and thus may not readily form boulders upon impact events. From comparisons with laboratory spectra of silicate and meteorite powders, Psyche's 7-14 μm emissivity spectrum is consistent with the presence of fine-grained (&lt; 75 μm) silicates on Psyche's surface. We conclude that Psyche is likely covered in a fine silicate regolith, which may also contain iron grains, overlying an iron-rich bedrock.",

We obtained 18 radar imaging and 6 continuous wave runs in November and December 2015, and combined these with 16 continuous wave runs from 2005 and 6 recent adaptive-optics (AO) images (Drummond et al., 2016) to generate a three-dimensional shape model of Psyche. Our model is consistent with a previously published AO image (Hanus et al., 2013) and three multi-chord occultations. Our shape model has dimensions 279 × 232 × 189 km (± 10%), D<SUB>eff</SUB> = 226 ± 23 km, and is 6% larger than, but within the uncertainties of, the most recently published size and shape model generated from the inversion of lightcurves (Hanus et al., 2013). Psyche is roughly ellipsoidal but displays a mass-deficit over a region spanning 90° of longitude. There is also evidence for two ∼50-70 km wide depressions near its south pole. Our size and published masses lead to an overall bulk density estimate of 4500 ± 1400 kgm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Psyche's mean radar albedo of 0.37 ± 0.09 is consistent with a near-surface regolith composed largely of iron-nickel and ∼40% porosity. Its radar reflectivity varies by a factor of 1.6 as the asteroid rotates, suggesting global variations in metal abundance or bulk density in the near surface. The variations in radar albedo appear to correlate with large and small-scale shape features. Our size and Psyche's published absolute magnitude lead to an optical albedo of p<SUB>v</SUB> = 0.15 ± 0.03, and there is evidence for albedo variegations that correlate with shape features.",

Radar observations have indicated the significant presence of metal on the surface with a small percentage of silicates. Prior ground-based observations showed rotational variations in the near-infrared (NIR) spectra and radar albedo of this asteroid. However, no comprehensive study that combines multi-wavelength data has been conducted so far. Here we present rotationally resolved NIR spectra (0.7-2.5 μm) of (16) Psyche obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. These data have been combined with shape models of the asteroid for each rotation phase. Spectral band parameters extracted from the NIR spectra show that the pyroxene band center varies from ∼0.92 to 0.94 μm. Band center values were used to calculate the pyroxene chemistry of the asteroid, whose average value was found to be Fs<SUB>30</SUB>En<SUB>65</SUB>Wo<SUB>5</SUB>. Variations in the band depth (BD) were also observed, with values ranging from 1.0% to 1.5%. Using a new laboratory spectral calibration method, we estimated an average orthopyroxene content of 6% ± 1%. The mass-deficit region of Psyche, which exhibits the highest radar albedo, also shows the highest value for the spectral slope and the minimum BD. The spectral characteristics of Psyche suggest that its parent body did not have the typical structure expected for a differentiated body or that the sequence of events that led to its current state was more complex than previously thought.",

This collision regime has been invoked to explain outstanding issues, such as planetary volatile loss records, origin of the Moon and mantle stripping from Mercury and some of the larger asteroids (Vesta, Psyche).We performed and analyzed a set of simulations of Hit-and-Run events, covering a large range of mass ratios (1-20), impact parameters (0.25-0.96, for near head-on to barely grazing) and impact velocities (~1.5-5 times the mutual escape velocity, as dependent on the mass ratio). We used an SPH code with tabulated EOS and a nominal simlated time &gt;1 day, to track the collisional shock processing and the provenance of material components. of collision debris. Prior to impact runs, all bodies were allowed to initially settle to negligible particle velocities in isolation, within ~20 simulated hrs. The total number of particles involved in each of our collision simulations was between (1-3 x 10<SUP>5</SUP>). Resulting configurations include stripped mantles, melting/vaporization of rock and/or iron cores and strong variations of asteroid parent bodies fromcanonical chondritic composition.In the context of large planetary formation simulations, velocity and impact angle distributions are necessary to asses impact probabilities. The mass distribution and interaction within planetary embryo and asteroid swarms depends both on gravitational dynamics and the applied fragmentation mechanism. We will present results pertaining to general projectile remnant scaling relations, constitution of ejected unbound material and the composition of variedcollision remnants, which become available to seed the asteroid belt.",

We find evidence for hydrated minerals on all six asteroids, including two that were previously thought to be dry. One of our targets, (216) Kleopatra, shows rotational variability in the depth of its 3-μm feature. We also studied three of these asteroids in the 0.8-2.4 μm range using the NICS instrument at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) in La Palma, Spain. The discovery of spectral signatures of hydrated minerals on so many M-types is difficult to reconcile with a highly thermally evolved composition. It has been suggested that the hydrated minerals could have been delivered to M-types via impacts with primitive objects, or that the M-types may actually have primitive compositions that are not represented in meteorite collections. Understanding the origin and type of hydration on these asteroids will help determine which of these interpretations is correct.",

All these meteorite groups are known to have experienced significant aqueous alteration (except the CKs). These IR measurements provide information about the parent body processes experienced, as well as spectra for comparison with observations of Solar System small bodies and possibly with astronomical observations of accretion and debris disks. <P />This study reveals that each meteorite group appears to have specific signatures in the measured IR spectral range. In the case of the CI and CM groups, results show a variability in the shape of the silicate features that can be related to the evolution of the mineralogy with increasing extent of aqueous alteration extent as described by several authors with other techniques. This evolution of the silicate feature can be seen in the variation in the relative intensities of olivine and phyllosilicate IR features. The variability in the silicate features is correlated with the intensity of an -OH related absorption at 3-μm, which can be used for the classification of the meteorites according to the level of hydration. Interestingly, in the case of CM chondrites, for which the mineralogy is expected to be dominated by phyllosilicates (serpentine mostly), the shape of the silicate absorption resembles that of an amorphous silicate, with a broad and symmetric 10-μm band, unlike terrestrial phyllosilicates. <P />The CV and CK groups have IR spectra that are dominated by olivine absorption. From this feature, it is possible to determine average Mg numbers for the olivine. For the CVs, the olivine Mg numbers appear to decrease in the order Kaba-Grosnaja-Vigarano-Mokoia-Allende. This trend is likely related to the long duration of metamorphism experienced by these samples and the chemical re-equilibration between chondritic components. In the case of CK chondrites, the inferred bulk Mg# of olivine is 67 (±1), and no variation is observed between the three studied samples, which is likely related to their high degree of equilibration. <P />The 6 CR chondrites show the most variability in their IR spectra, from CM-like spectra in the case of the CR1 Grosvenor Mountains (GRO) 95577 to CV-like spectra for Roberts Massif (RBT) 04133 and Graves Nunataks (GRA) 06100 (one of them being most probably misclassified). Spectra of the remaining CRs show mixtures of various silicate component. <P />Finally, these spectra can be used for comparison with emission spectra of fine-grained asteroid surfaces and dust-rich cometary tails. In the case of Tempel 1, the only group of CC that matches the observed feature around 10-μm region is the CR group. The spectral comparison shows some striking similarities between CRs and Tempel 1 dust. A genetic link between CR2 and comets is not proven, but mineralogical similarities are suggested from the IR spectra.",

Our underlying hypothesis is that the position and shape of the 3 μm band is diagnostic of phyllosilicate mineralogy. We measured reflectance spectra of the chondrites under dry conditions (elevated temperatures) and vacuum (10<SUP>-8</SUP> to 10<SUP>-7</SUP> torr) to minimize adsorbed water and mimic the space environment, for subsequent comparison with reflectance spectra of asteroids. We have identified three spectral CM groups in addition to Ivuna. \"Group 1,\" the least altered group as determined from various alteration indices, is characterized by 3 μm band centers at longer wavelengths, and is consistent with cronstedtite (Fe-serpentine). \"Group 3,\" the most altered group, is characterized by 3 μm band centers at shorter wavelengths and is consistent with antigorite (serpentine). \"Group 2\" is an intermediate group between group 1 and 3. Ivuna exhibits a unique spectrum that is distinct from the CM meteorites and is consistent with lizardite and chrysotile (serpentine). The petrologic and geochemical parameters, which were determined using electron microprobe analyses and microscopic observations, are found to be consistent with the three spectral groups. These results indicate that the distinct parent body aqueous alteration environments experienced by these carbonaceous chondrites can be distinguished using reflectance spectroscopy. High-quality ground-based telescopic observations of Main Belt asteroids can be expected to reveal not just whether an asteroid is hydrated, but also details of the alteration state.",

The hypothesis we are testing is whether planetesimals that accreted closer to the Sun experienced a higher degree of aqueous alteration. We would expect then to see a gradual decline of the abundance of hydrated minerals among the outer Main Belt asteroids with increasing heliocentric distance (2.5 &lt; a &lt; 4.0 AU). We measured spectra (0.8-2.5 μm and 1.9-4.1 μm) of 28 outer Main Belt asteroids using the SpeX spectrograph/imager at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We identified four groups on the basis of the shape and the band center of the 3-μm feature. The first group, which we call \"sharp\", exhibits a sharp 3-μm feature, attributed to hydrated minerals (phyllosilicates). Most asteroids in this group are located in the 2.5 &lt; a &lt; 3.3 AU region. The second group, which we call \"Ceres-like\", consists of 10 Hygiea and 324 Bamberga. Like Asteroid Ceres, these asteroids exhibit a 3-μm feature with a band center of 3.05 ± 0.01 μm that is superimposed on a broader absorption feature from ∼2.8 to 3.7 μm. The third group, which we call \"Europa-like\", includes 52 Europa, 31 Euphrosyne, and 451 Patientia. Objects in this group exhibit a 3-μm feature with a band center of 3.15 ± 0.01 μm. Both the Ceres-like and Europa-like groups are concentrated in the 2.5 &lt; a &lt; 3.3 AU region. The fourth group, which we call \"rounded\", is concentrated in the 3.4 &lt; a &lt; 4.0 AU region. Asteroids in this group are characterized by a rounded 3-μm feature, attributed to H<SUB>2</SUB>O ice. A similar rounded 3-μm feature was also identified in 24 Themis and 65 Cybele. Unlike the sharp group, the rounded group did not experience aqueous alteration. Of the asteroids observed in this study, 140 Siwa, a P-type, is the only one that does not exhibit a 3-μm feature. These results are important to constrain the nature and the degree of aqueous alteration in outer Main Belt asteroids.",

There are considerable regional and local variations across the asteroid: Spectrally distinct regions include the south-polar Rheasilvia basin, which displays a higher diogenitic component, and equatorial regions, which show a higher eucritic component. The lithologic distribution indicates a deeper diogenitic crust, exposed after excavation by the impact that formed Rheasilvia, and an upper eucritic crust. Evidence for mineralogical stratigraphic layering is observed on crater walls and in ejecta. This is broadly consistent with magma-ocean models, but spectral variability highlights local variations, which suggests that the crust can be a complex assemblage of eucritic basalts and pyroxene cumulates. Overall, Vesta mineralogy indicates a complex magmatic evolution that led to a differentiated crust and mantle.",

Nineteen asteroids (42%) exhibit weak Band I (approximately 0.9 μm) ± Band II (approximately 1.9 μm) absorptions, three asteroids (7%) exhibit a weak Band I (approximately 1.05-1.08 μm) olivine absorption, four asteroids (9%) display multiple absorptions suggesting phyllosilicate ± oxide/hydroxide minerals, one (1) asteroid exhibits an S-asteroid type NIR spectrum, and 18 asteroids (40%) are spectrally featureless in the NIR, but have widely varying slopes. Tholen M-asteroids are defined as asteroids exhibiting featureless visible-wavelength (λ) spectra with moderate albedos (Tholen 1989). Tholen X-asteroids are also defined using the same spectral criterion, but without albedo information. Previous work has suggested spectral and mineralogical diversity in the M-asteroid population (Rivkin et al. 1995, 2000; Busarev 2002; Clark et al. 2004; Hardersen et al. 2005; Birlan et al. 2007; Ockert-Bell et al. 2008, 2010; Shepard et al. 2008, 2010; Fornasier et al. 2010). The pyroxene-bearing asteroids are dominated by orthopyroxene with several likely to include higher-Ca clinopyroxene components. Potential meteorite analogs include mesosiderites, CB/CH chondrites, and silicate-bearing NiFe meteorites. The Eos family, olivine-bearing asteroids are most consistent with a CO chondrite analog. The aqueously altered asteroids display multiple, weak absorptions (0.85, 0.92, 0.97, 1.10, 1.40, and 2.30-2.50 μm) indicative of phyllosilicate ± hydroxide minerals.

Taken together, these show deeper 3-μm band depths (of order 3-5%) in the southern hemisphere of Lutetia, and shallower band depths (of order 2% or less) in the north. Such variation is consistent with observations at shorter wavelength by previous workers (Nedelcu, D.A. et al. [2007]. Astron. Astrophys. 470, 1157-1164; Lazzarin, M. et al. [2010]. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 408, 1433-1437), who observed hemispheric-level variations from C-like spectra to X-like spectra. While the shallowness of absorption bands on Lutetia hinders identification of its surface composition, goethite appears plausible as a constituent in its southern hemisphere (Beck, P., Quirico, E., Sevestre, D., Montes-Hernandez, G., Pommerol, A., Schmitt, B. [2011]. Astron. Astrophys. 526, A85-A89). Mathematical models of space weathered goethite are most consistent with Lutetia's southern hemisphere spectrum, but more work and further observations are necessary to confirm this suggestion.",

Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson), are medium albedo bodies supposed to have a metallic composition and to be the progenitors both of differentiated iron-nickel meteorites and enstatite chondrites. We carried out a spectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared wavelength range (0.4-2.5 μm) of 30 asteroids chosen from the population of asteroids initially classified as Tholen M-types, aiming to investigate their surface composition. The data were obtained during several observing runs during the years 2004-2007 at the TNG, NTT, and IRTF telescopes. We computed the spectral slopes in several wavelength ranges for each observed asteroid, and we searched for diagnostic spectral features. We confirm a large variety of spectral behaviors for these objects as their spectra are extended into the near infrared, including the identification of weak absorption bands, mainly of the 0.9 μm band tentatively attributed to orthopyroxene, and of the 0.43 μm band that may be associated to chlorites and Mg-rich serpentines or pyroxene minerals such us pigeonite or augite. A comparison with previously published data indicates that the surfaces of several asteroids belonging to the M-class may vary significantly. We attempt to constrain the asteroid surface compositions of our sample by looking for meteorite spectral analogs in the RELAB database and by modeling with geographical mixtures of selected meteorites/minerals. We confirm that iron meteorites, pallasites, and enstatite chondrites are the best matches to most objects in our sample, as suggested for M-type asteroids. For 22 Kalliope, we demonstrate that a synthetic mixture obtained enriching a pallasite meteorite with small amounts (1-2%) of silicates well reproduce the spectral behavior including the observed 0.9 μm feature. The presence of subtle absorption features on several asteroids confirms that not all objects defined by the Tholen M-class have a pure metallic composition. A statistical analysis of spectral slope distribution vs. orbital parameters shows that our sample originally defined as Tholen M-types tend to be dark in albedo and red in slope for increasing value of the semi-major axis. However, we note that our sample is statistically limited by our number of objects (30) and slightly varying results are found for different subsets. If confirmed, the albedo and slope trends could be due to a difference in composition of objects belonging to the outer main belt, or alternatively to a combination of surface composition, grain size and space weathering effects.",

      "abstract": "It has been suggested that Earth's current supply of water was delivered by asteroids, some time after the collision that produced the Moon (which would have vaporized any of the pre-existing water). So far, no measurements of water ice on asteroids have been made, but its presence has been inferred from the comet-like activity of several small asteroids, including two members of the Themis dynamical family. Here we report infrared spectra of the asteroid 24 Themis which show that ice and organic compounds are not only present on its surface but also prevalent. Infrared spectral differences between it and other asteroids make 24 Themis unique so far, and our identification of ice and organics agrees with independent results that rule out other compounds as possible sources of the observed spectral structure. The widespread presence of surface ice on 24 Themis is somewhat unexpected because of the relatively short lifetime of exposed ice at this distance (~3.2AU) from the Sun. Nevertheless, there are several plausible sources, such as a subsurface reservoir that brings water to the surface through `impact gardening' and/or sublimation.",

Here we report the spectroscopic detection of water ice and organic material on the asteroid 24 Themis, a detection that has been independently confirmed. 24 Themis belongs to the same dynamical family as three of the five known MBCs, and the presence of ice on 24 Themis is strong evidence that it also is present in the MBCs.

Some remotely observed features, however, indicate that Ceres may instead have a composition more similar to that of the most common types of carbonaceous meteorite. In particular, Ceres has been shown to have a distinct infrared absorption feature centred at a wavelength of ~3.06μm that is superimposed on a broader absorption from ~2.8 to 3.7μm (refs 5, 8), which suggests the presence of OH- or H<SUB>2</SUB>O-bearing phases. The specific mineral composition of Ceres and its relationship to known meteorite mineral assemblages, however, remains uncertain. Here we show that the spectral features of Ceres can be attributed to the presence of the hydroxide brucite, magnesium carbonates and serpentines, a mineralogy consistent with the aqueous alteration of olivine-rich materials. We therefore suggest that the thermal and aqueous alteration history of Ceres is different from that recorded by carbonaceous meteorites, and that samples from Ceres are not represented in existing meteorite collections.",

The metal-rich lithologies with 50-60 vol% of Fe,Ni metal are dominant. The metal-rich and metal-poor lithologies are most similar to the CB<SUB>b</SUB> and CH carbonaceous chondrites, respectively, providing a potential link between these chondrite groups. All lithologies experienced shock metamorphism of shock stage S4. All consist of similar components—Fe,Ni metal, chondrules, refractory inclusions (Ca, Al-rich inclusions [CAIs] and amoeboid olivine aggregates [AOAs]), and heavily hydrated lithic clasts—but show differences in their modal abundances, chondrule sizes, and proportions of porphyritic versus non-porphyritic chondrules. Bulk chemical and oxygen isotopic compositions are in the range of CH and CB chondrites. Bulk nitrogen isotopic composition is highly enriched in <SUP>15</SUP>N (δ<SUP>15</SUP>N = 1122‰). The magnetic fraction is very similar to the bulk sample in terms of both nitrogen release pattern and isotopic profile; the non-magnetic fraction contains significantly less heavy N. Carbon released at high temperatures shows a relatively heavy isotope signature. Similarly to CB<SUB>b</SUB> chondrites, ∼20% of Fe,Ni-metal grains in Isheyevo are chemically zoned. Similarly to CH chondrites, some metal grains are Ni-rich (&gt;20 wt% Ni). In contrast to CB<SUB>b</SUB> and CH chondrites, most metal grains are thermally decomposed into Ni-rich and Ni-poor phases. Similar to CH chondrites, chondrules have porphyritic and non-porphyritic textures and ferromagnesian (type I and II), silica-rich, and aluminum-rich bulk compositions. Some of the layered ferromagnesian chondrules are surrounded by ferrous olivine or phyllosilicate rims. Phyllosilicates in chondrule rims are compositionally distinct from those in the hydrated lithic clasts. Similarly to CH chondrites, CAIs are dominated by the hibonite-, grossite-, and melilite-rich types; AOAs are very rare. We infer that Isheyevo is a complex mixture of materials formed by different processes and under different physico-chemical conditions. Chondrules and refractory inclusions of two populations, metal grains, and heavily hydrated clasts accreted together into the Isheyevo parent asteroid in a region of the protoplanetary disk depleted in fine-grained dust. Such a scenario is consistent with the presence of solar wind—implanted noble gases in Isheyevo and with its comparatively old K-Ar age. We cannot exclude that the K-Ar system was affected by a later collisional event. The cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) age of Isheyevo determined by cosmogenic <SUP>38</SUP>Ar is ∼34 Ma, similar to that of the Bencubbin (CB<SUB>a</SUB>) meteorite.",

      "abstract": "Asteroids have been used extensively as calibration sources for the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and are planned to be used by future groundbased, airborne and space-based projects in the thermal infrared (IR) and in the sub-millimetre. We summarize the general IR observational parameters with a focus on space observatories and discuss brightness variations, apparent velocities and background influences. During the ISO mission ten well-studied asteroids were used for the photometric calibration of ISOPHOT, but additionally the bright asteroids turned out to be of great interest for many technical tests and calibration aspects. We evaluated the different applications, like testing the photometry of the spectrometers, validation of relative spectral response functions, determination of beam profiles or colour correction tests. The description of the asteroids' thermal emission has been obtained by a recent thermophysical model (TPM). The important model aspects are size, albedo, shape together with the spin vector, a beaming model, thermal inertia and a wavelength-dependent emissivity. With a large sample of observational data provided by three different ISO instruments we had for the first time the possibility to study the thermal emission of several asteroids in detail. The intercomparison between results from different instruments allowed us to distinguish between observational errors and model shortcomings. It turned out that the accuracy of TPM predictions is in many cases strongly related to the limited knowledge of the asteroid shapes. The concepts of beaming, thermal inertia and wavelength dependent emissivities were nicely confirmed for a wide range of observing and illumination geometries under many aspect angles for different asteroids. The TPM predictions for <ASTROBJ>Ceres</ASTROBJ>, <ASTROBJ>Pallas</ASTROBJ> and <ASTROBJ>Vesta</ASTROBJ> are accurate within 5% over the full wavelength range from 5 to 200 μm, for <ASTROBJ>Hygiea</ASTROBJ> and a few other asteroids the predictions and observations agree within 10 to 15%. We found similar emissivity behaviour for the four large asteroids over the full ISO wavelength range. Up to now, no clear spectral features have been seen in the asteroid far-IR spectra.

(1990) for a total of 27 asteroids, we find that over 35% of them have absorption features at 3 μm diagnostic of water of hydration. This absorption feature is inconsistent with these M-class asteroids being primarily Fe-Ni metal, which would be expected if they were remnant cores of disrupted differentiated objects. We also find that large ( D&gt;65 km) M asteroids are very likely to be hydrated (75%), while small ( D&lt;65 km) M asteroids are very unlikely to be hydrated (10%). We believe the interpretation most consistent with all data (astronomical, meteoritical, and geochemical modeling) holds the large M-class asteroids to be relatively primitive material perhaps akin to enstatite chondrites or salt-rich carbonaceous chondrites, with the iron meteorites found on Earth perhaps deriving from the smaller, anhydrous M asteroids. In keeping with Rivkin et al. (1995), we place the hydrated M asteroids in the separate W class.",

However, there is no dynamical family associated with Psyche nor are there spectroscopic data for the existence of the mantle or crustal material from the parent body. The usual explanation for the missing material requires that the Psyche parent body was collisionally disrupted early in solar system history, followed by collisional grinding of the family down to below the current observational limit sizes. <P />We test the exposed core hypothesis for the origin of Psyche using a numerical code that simultaneously calculates both the collisional evolution of the asteroid belt and the model family formed by the breakup of the Psyche parent body (PPB). We find that it would take a projectile about 300-350 km in size to thoroughly disrupt a 500-km asteroid (the estimated size of the PPB), and that the probability of such an event occurring in the first 500 Ma of solar system history is only about 1%. While the Psyche model family is found to have been significantly ground down subsequent to its formation, there should be several tens of survivors from the mantle and crust larger than ∼10 km that should be spectroscopically detectable by current technology. Although only a small fraction of the asteroids larger than 10 km have been discovered and observed spectroscopically to date, none have been identified as potential survivors from the PPB (Burbineet al.1996, Meteor. Planet. Sci. 31, 607-620). <P />Given the low probability of the disruption of a Vesta-like body and the lack of either dynamical or observational confirmation of a family or material from the parent body, we think it more likely that Psyche has possibly been shattered by impacts but not catastrophically disrupted. In this case, it would be a plausible candidate parent body for the mesosiderites. The exposed-core scenario more probably applies to other, smaller (diameter ≲100 km) M-type asteroids, which could be the parent bodies of the iron meteorites. However, this interpretation raises the interesting problem of why among the larger asteroids only Vesta and the PPB would have been fully differentiated.",

The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security–Regolith Explorer) mission documented numerous locations on Bennu exhibiting evidence of such mass movements, including one contained within Bralgah Crater. This area was considered (though not used) by the mission as a candidate site for sample collection; thus, high-resolution images collected during reconnaissance of this area enabled us to resolve a smaller minimum boulder size than would be possible elsewhere. Through boulder mapping and topographic analysis, we found evidence of a pileup behind a large central boulder, a flow \"wake\" downhill with a relative lack of medium-sized boulders, as well as a strong orientational preference of the boulders in this area, with the long axes of the boulders pointing westward of the expected direction of motion. We performed dynamical simulations of seismic shaking using the discrete-element N-body code PKDGRAV to better constrain the conditions that may have formed the landscape. In these simulations, we were able to replicate the pileup of material uphill from the central boulder and the wake downhill from it. Comparisons with previous simulations of seismic shaking–induced mass movements show that material transport is not directly related to the shaking intensity, but instead can be maximized by dominant shaking frequencies. Simulations also showed a preferential orientation emerging, with a strong possibility for preferential orientation parallel to direction of motion. Combined with the orientational preference observed in this and other studies of Bennu's landscape, this indicates that the Coriolis effect could be a major factor in the surface evolution of Bennu and other small bodies. Finally, we estimated the impactor sizes that would instigate our simulated shaking parameters, showing that Bennu could have encountered such impactors within its near-Earth lifetime.",

Our simulations indicate that monolayer coatings of sand- to pebble-sized particles, as observed on one of these rocks, could significantly reduce the apparent thermal inertia and largely mask the properties of the substrate. However, the other low-thermal-inertia rock that was contacted is not obviously covered in particles. Moreover, this rock appears to have been partially crushed, and thus potentially sampled, by the spacecraft.

Focusing specifically on the insoluble organic matter (IOM), this study establishes that a total of 1.3 g of bulk sample from a single chondritic meteorite are sufficient to obtain a wide range of cosmochemical information, including light element analysis (H, C, and N), isotopic analysis (D/H, <SUP>13</SUP>C/<SUP>12</SUP>C, and <SUP>15</SUP>N/<SUP>14</SUP>N), and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy for major elemental abundances. IOM isolated from the bulk meteorite samples was analyzed by light element and isotopic analysis as described above, <SUP>1</SUP>H and <SUP>13</SUP>C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and complete noble gas analyses (abundances and isotopes). The samples studied included a pair from Murchison (CM2), one of which had been irradiated with high-energy x-rays in the course of computed tomographic imaging. No differences between the irradiated and non-irradiated Murchison samples were observed in the many different chemical and spectroscopic analyses, indicating that any x-ray-derived sample damage is below levels of detection. Elemental, isotopic, and molecular spectroscopic data derived from IOM isolated from the Sutter's Mill sample reveals evidence that this meteorite falls into the class of heated CM chondrites.",

It will be used as part of the preliminary examination of samples returned from asteroid (101955) Bennu by the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission. However, it must first be established whether x-rays generated during XCT could degrade or alter the organic composition of the returned samples by radiolysis. To test this, we split a crushed sample of the Murchison CM2 meteorite, kept one portion as a control, and irradiated the other portion up to the maximum x-ray dosage (~180 Gy) that a Bennu sample would experience during an XCT imaging experiment. We then extracted organic compounds from both splits and conducted (i) nontargeted soluble organic analyses to compare the chemical distributions of C-, H-, O-, N-, and S-bearing species and (ii) targeted measurements to quantify the abundances of 96 individual soluble organic molecules that included protein amino acids, amines, carboxylic acids, hydroxy acids, carbonyl compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, sugars, and N-heterocycles. We found that XCT imaging of the Murchison meteorite had no measurable impact on the relative abundances or enantiomeric compositions of most of the soluble organic compounds targeted in this study. Elevated total abundances of several soluble organic compound classes were observed in the XCT-scanned Murchison sample relative to the control. This is likely related to particle size heterogeneity and specific surface area differences between the sample aliquots used for the extractions, rather than a result of the x-ray exposure. Assuming the samples returned from asteroid Bennu by OSIRIS-REx have a similar composition to carbonaceous chondrites, these data provide confidence that XCT will not significantly alter their soluble organic compositions.",

      "abstract": "We use observations of Bennu's impact craters, and measurements of particle sizes seen in images from the OSIRIS-REx (the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification Regolith Explorer sample-return mission) sampling event, to conclude there is a ∼ global sub-surface layer of finer-grained material on Bennu. The layer is evident in particle measurements from areas inside and around craters, roughness assessments of crater interiors vs. surrounding terrain, crater colors, crater depth-to-diameter (d/D) ratios, and the global crater size-frequency distribution. All data sets show a transition in behavior at crater diameters between 20 m and 40 m, with the most abrupt changes at ∼25 m diameter. Based on the depth of ∼25 m diameter craters, we infer that the layer is 1-4 m thick. The reddest craters are the youngest craters, and there is a trend to older ages as redness decreases. The decrease in redness is characterized by an initial, rapid fade, followed by a slower fade. The reduction in expected crater abundance with diameters ∼40-80 m, when extrapolating from larger sizes, is consistent with impact armoring caused by deeper, large sub-surface boulders depressing crater diameter. The existence of the layer appears to be a natural byproduct of impacts across a wide energy range and can be described as a \"punctuated equilibrium\": small, frequent impacts contribute to the local production of finer-grained particles and locally mix smaller particles into the subsurface; larger, less-frequent large impacts eject the fine-grained material, exposing interior boulders, and resetting the finer-grained particle population in that area. Other processes, e.g. thermal fracturing, could also contribute to the production of fine-grained material on rapid timescales. Extrapolating to the broader asteroid population and considering the production and preservation of small particles is related to target strength, surface acceleration, and impact speeds, we expect to find such layers on other asteroids, and that the layer thickness and depth will vary with composition, size, and orbital parameters.",

To better understand Bennu's parent body, we identified boulders over 2 m in diameter around the Nightingale region and analyzed normal albedo, morphology, and surface roughness. We found that boulders can be separated into two groups based on albedo, and four groups using morphology including angularity, texture, and the presence or absence of clasts, layers, and bright spots: Type A is rounded, rugged, and clastic, with the highest root-mean square deviation roughness; Type B is sub-angular with intermediate roughness and polygonal surface fractures; Type C is angular, has distinct fractures, and the lowest roughness; and Type D is sub-angular with intermediate roughness and bright spots. Unsupervised clustering algorithms showed that our Type A-D classification represents the diversity in the morphology and albedo data. Using documented contacts between boulder groups, we conclude that boulders on Bennu originated on a single, heterogeneous parent body that experienced vertical mixing via impacts prior to or during its disruption. The boulder morphologies on Bennu bear striking resemblance to those on asteroid Ryugu, potentially suggesting a shared origin. Finally, from analyses of sample collection images, we predict that the sample will be heterogeneous in morphology, brightness, and degree of aqueous alteration and dominated by darker Type A and B material. These predictions are supported by initial analyses of the Ryugu sample.",

The spacecraft collected loose regolith two ways: in a bulk sample chamber capable of holding up to 2 kg, and on industrial Velcro \"contact pads\" intended to collect small particles at the surface. Included in the JSC collection will be the bulk sample, the contact pads, contamination-monitoring witness plates, and supporting hardware. Planning for the curation of the samples and hardware started at the earliest phase of proposal development and continued in parallel with project development and execution. Because a major mission goal is characterization of organic compounds in the Bennu samples, extra effort was spent in the design stage to ensure a clean curation environment. Here, we describe the preparations to receive the sample, including the design, construction, outfitting, and monitoring of the cleanrooms at JSC; the planned recovery of the sample-containing capsule when it lands on Earth; and the approach to characterizing and cataloging the samples. These curation efforts will result in the distribution of pristine Bennu samples from JSC to the OSIRIS-REx science team, international partners, and the global scientific community for years to come.",

The sampling 'Touch-And-Go' (TAG) maneuver was performed nominally at the primary sampling site, Nightingale, in Bennu's Northern hemisphere. As a consequence of the TAG, material at the sampling site was mobilized and the morphology of the area was altered. This event offered a unique opportunity to investigate, in detail, the subsurface of asteroid Bennu giving access to fine grained and less altered material from Nightingale crater. We performed a detailed study on the infrared spectrum in the Nightingale region to search for modification resulting from the sampling event by analysing different features: slope, the H<SUB>2</SUB>O-OH<SUP>-</SUP> related absorption band in the $2.7\\ \\mu {\\rm m}$ region, and other possible features. Our results show that, despite visible alteration of the TAG location detected by cameras, no strong variations are observed in the near-infrared bands and their quantitative evaluation is not possible beyond all the instrumental effects, although some changes may have occurred. We confirm that the infrared spectrum of the sampling site becomes redder with respect to the pre-TAG observations, conceivably due to fine material mobilization and exposure of less altered material, as confirmed by decreased spectral convexity. We identify possible modification of hydrated band at $2.7\\ \\mu {\\rm m}$ but with some concerns due to data quality. However, our results place new constraints on the nature of Bennu's subsurface material and the sample collected by OSIRIS-REx.",

Here we use data from the OSIRIS-REx laser altimeter (OLA) to measure the depths, d, and diameters, D, of a sample of small (D ≤ 10 m) impact craters that span a broad range of latitudes and longitudes. d/D in this sample ranges from 0.04 to 0.27, with a mean of 0.13 ± 0.04. Compared to larger (D ≥ 10 m) craters on Bennu, those studied here have a greater average d/D. The mean d/D of craters on Bennu's younger, Rugged Unit is statistically larger than the mean d/D of those on the older, Smooth Unit. One of the studied craters contains an interior mound that may indicate the presence of stronger material at depth. A large fraction of craters studied here are located near large boulders whose lengths are &gt;50% the diameter of the crater. Some of these large boulders cross the crater rim crest, protruding into and perched above the crater interior. In the most extreme cases, the boulder length is ~2.5 times the crater diameter. The d/D of craters near large boulders is bimodal, which could be a consequence of how boulders affect crater formation. Laboratory experiments and results from Hayabusa2's Small Carry-On Impactor experiment indicate that preexisting boulders and heterogeneities affect crater formation and d/D. The abundance of small craters on Bennu makes the asteroid a rich resource for understanding impact processes.",

      "abstract": "Global geologic maps are useful tools for efficient interpretation of a planetary body, and they provide global context for the diversity and evolution of the surface. We used data acquired by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft to create the first global geologic map of the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu. As this is the first geologic map of a small, non-spherical, rubble-pile asteroid, we discuss the distinctive mapping challenges and best practices that may be useful for future exploration of similar asteroids, such as those to be visited with the Hera and Janus missions. By mapping on two centimeter-scale global image mosaics (2D projected space) and a centimeter-scale global shape model (3D space), we generated three input maps respectively describing Bennu's shape features, geologic features, and surface texture. Based on these input maps, we defined two geologic units: the Smooth Unit and the Rugged Unit. The units are differentiated primarily on the basis of surface texture, concentrations of boulders, and the distributions of lineaments, mass movement features, and craters. They are bounded by several scarps. The Rugged Unit contains abundant boulders and signs of recent mass movement. It also has fewer small (&lt;20 m), putatively fresh craters than the Smooth Unit, suggesting that such craters have been erased in the former. Based on these geologic indicators, we infer that the Rugged Unit has the younger surface of the two. Differential crater size-frequency distributions and the distribution of the freshest craters suggest that both unit surfaces formed ~10-65 million years ago, when Bennu was located in the Main Asteroid Belt, and the Smooth Unit has not been significantly resurfaced in the past 2 million years. Meanwhile, the Rugged Unit has experienced resurfacing within the past ~500,000 years during Bennu's lifetime as a near-Earth asteroid. The geologic units are consistent with global diversity in slope, surface roughness, normal albedo, and thermal emission spectral characteristics. The site on Bennu where the OSIRIS-REx mission collected a regolith sample is located in the Smooth Unit, in a small crater nested within a larger one. So although the Smooth Unit is an older surface than the Rugged Unit, the impact-crater setting indicates that the material sampled was recently exposed. Several similarities are apparent between Bennu and asteroid (162173) Ryugu from a global geologic perspective, including two geologic units distinguishable by variations in the number density of boulders, as well as in other datasets such as brightness.",

Before sample collection, spectral observations of four regions of interest on Bennu's surface were acquired at high spatial resolution (2-9 m per spectrometer spot) to identify the most suitable site for sampling and provide contextual information for the returned sample. In this study, we investigate thermal-infrared (6-50 μm) observations of these four regions, including the site that OSIRIS-REx ultimately sampled, using the Advanced Thermophysical Model with input digital terrain models derived from laser altimetry. From model-to-measurement comparisons, we find that the observed brightness temperatures depend strongly on small-scale topography, local variations in thermal inertia, and the observation phase angle. Thermal inertia mapping reveals spatial variations that distinguish the different boulder types found on Bennu. A boulder bearing carbonate veins has higher thermal inertia than average, suggesting that cementation processes reduced its porosity. The thermal inertia of the site sampled is 190 ± 30 J m<SUP>−2</SUP> K<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1/2</SUP>, which is consistent with observations of a fine-grained regolith mixed with porous rocks. Thermophysical modeling of the site sampled predicts that the maximum temperatures experienced by the collected sample while on Bennu were 357 ± 3 and 261 ± 3 K for the surface and 50 cm depth, respectively. We predict that OSIRIS-REx will return a sample with thermophysical properties unique from those of meteorites.",

Selecting a sample collection site on Bennu's surface was challenging due to the surprising lack of large ponded deposits of regolith particles exclusively fine enough (≤2 cm diameter) to be ingested by the spacecraft's Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM). Here we describe the Sampleability Map of Bennu, which was constructed to aid in the selection of candidate sampling sites and to estimate the probability of collecting sufficient sample. \"Sampleability\" is a numeric score that expresses the compatibility of a given area's surface properties with the sampling mechanism. The algorithm that determines sampleability is a best fit functional form to an extensive suite of laboratory testing outcomes tracking the TAGSAM performance as a function of four observable properties of the target asteroid. The algorithm and testing were designed to measure and subsequently predict TAGSAM collection amounts as a function of the minimum particle size, maximum particle size, particle size frequency distribution, and the tilt of the TAGSAM head off the surface. The sampleability algorithm operated at two general scales, consistent with the resolution and coverage of data collected during the mission. The first scale was global and evaluated nearly the full surface. Due to Bennu's unexpected boulder coverage and lack of ponded regolith deposits, the global sampleability efforts relied heavily on additional strategies to find and characterize regions of interest based on quantifying and avoiding areas heavily covered by material too large to be collected. The second scale was site-specific and used higher-resolution data to predict collected mass at a given contact location. The rigorous sampleability assessments gave the mission confidence to select the best possible sample collection site and directly enabled successful collection of hundreds of grams of material.",

This system, called Natural Feature Tracking (NFT), works by rendering features from digital terrain models and then correlating them with the terrain in real-time navigation images to estimate the spacecraft's position and velocity with respect to the asteroid. Here we describe how the OSIRIS-REx mission built the catalog of features for NFT and how those features performed during rehearsals for and execution of the Touch-and-Go (TAG) sample collection event. Feature performance (quality and accuracy of match) in the rendering and correlation process is the basis of the NFT measurement. All features scored well above the minimum correlation threshold thanks to the effort invested in selecting and modeling them. Residuals across the TAG trajectory were small, indicating that features in the catalog were defined consistently relative to each other. NFT delivered the spacecraft to within 1 m of the targeted location, with a difference of only 3.5 cm and 1.4 s from the predicted location and time of touch. This exceptional performance was crucial for spacecraft safety given Bennu's rough and hazardous terrain.",

As the first NASA asteroid sample return mission, OSIRIS-REx deployed several new technologies to achieve program objectives. Here we present an overview of Natural Feature Tracking (NFT), a system developed to autonomously guide the spacecraft to the desired sampling site using optical navigation and the natural terrain on the surface of Bennu. NFT utilized a series of image-based digital terrain models (DTMs) constructed by means of stereophotoclinometry to represent patches on the surface of the asteroid. These DTMs were used to generate synthetic renderings of the terrain and identify features for use in navigating to the sampling location. In addition, high-resolution models of the sampling site constructed from scanning lidar data were used for predicting the time and location of contact with the surface. These models went through a series of validation tests to ensure the performance of the NFT system. When the spacecraft executed the sampling trajectory in 2020 October, NFT enabled real-time guidance updates that delivered it safely to the desired sampling location while also providing critical hazard avoidance capabilities in the rocky Bennu environment.",

This achievement leveraged an autonomous optical navigation approach called Natural Feature Tracking (NFT). NFT provided spacecraft state updates by correlating asteroid surface features rendered from previously acquired terrain data with images taken by the onboard navigation camera. The success of NFT was the culmination of years of preparation and collaboration to ensure that feature data would meet navigation requirements. This paper presents the findings from ground testing performed prior to the spacecraft's arrival at Bennu, in which synthetic data were used to develop and validate the technical approach for building NFT features. Correlation sensitivity testing using synthetic models of Bennu enabled the team to characterize the terrain properties that worked well for feature correlation, the challenges posed by smoother terrain, and the impact of imaging conditions on correlation performance. The team found that models constructed from image data by means of stereophotoclinometry (SPC) worked better than those constructed from laser altimetry data, except when test image pixel sizes were more than a factor of 2 smaller than those of the images used for SPC, and when topography was underrepresented and resulted in incorrect shadows in rendered features. Degradation of laser altimetry data related to noise and spatial sampling also led to poor correlation performance. Albedo variation was found to be a key contributor to correlation performance; topographic data alone were insufficient for NFT.",

We explore the geology of the sample collection site, known as Nightingale, by using digital terrain models, relative albedo maps, and images collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. Hokioi crater sits at the northwest edge of an older, larger (120 m diameter) crater between two north-south ridges respectively located at roughly 0° and 90° longitude, between which unconsolidated material generally migrates from the geopotential high at the north (+Z) pole to the geopotential low at the equator. The impact that formed Hokioi crater exposed relatively unweathered, fine-grained dark material that we observe within and ejected beyond the crater. The regional slope and steep crater walls to the north of the Nightingale site have enabled a mix of the dark debris and brighter material (which may include carbonates and/or exogenic basalts) surrounding Hokioi crater to migrate onto the crater floor, where the sample was collected; some of this material may be old ejecta excavated from up to 10 m depth when the 120 m diameter crater formed. We therefore expect the OSIRIS-REx sample to include materials of varying brightnesses, compositions, and exposure ages, derived primarily from the 0°-90° longitude quadrant and from as deep as 10 m. The sample may also include material derived from the impactor that formed Hokioi crater. We expect it to have low cohesion (≪0.6 Pa) and a friction angle between 32° and 39°.",

Machine learning multivariate analysis can estimate modal mineralogy of mixtures and is favorable because it does not assume linear mixing across wavelengths. We used partial least squares (PLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), two types of machine learning, to build MIR spectral models to determine the surface mineralogy of the asteroid (101955) Bennu using OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) data. We find that PLS models outperform lasso models. The cross-validated root-mean-square error of our final PLS models (consisting of 317 unique spectra of samples derived from 13 analog mineral samples and eight meteorites) range from ∼4 to 13 vol% depending on the mineral group. PLS predictions in vol% of Bennu's average global composition are 78% phyllosilicate, 9% olivine, 11% carbonates, and 6% magnetite. Pyroxene is not predicted for the global average spectrum, though it has been detected in small amounts on Bennu. These mineral abundances confirm previous findings that the composition of Bennu is consistent with CI/CM chondrites with high degrees of aqueous alteration. The predicted mineralogy of two previously identified OTES spectral types vary minimally from the global average. In agreement with previous work, we interpret OTES spectral differences as primarily caused by relative abundances of fine particulates rather than major compositional variations.",

For the successful Touch And Go sample acquisition maneuver, the shape and mass of the asteroid needed to be known precisely. Here we use a combination of radiometric, image landmark, and laser altimetry data to determine Bennu's mass, shape, and orientation simultaneously and to verify existing models thereof. Our shape determination consists of estimating a scale factor and three frame rotation angles that apply to both the global digital terrain model (GDTM) and the landmark coordinates. We use a data type called image constraints, where we take the difference of the observation of the same landmark in images taken at two different times. We analyze data from two phases of the OSIRIS-REx mission, Orbital B and Recon B, and show that interphase image constraints greatly reduce interdependencies between estimated parameters for mass, GDTM scale, and biases on the altimetry data. This results in an improved solution for the mass and shape relative to considering a single mission phase. We find Bennu's gravitational parameter GM to be 4.89256 ± 0.00035 m<SUP>3</SUP> s<SUP>-2</SUP>, and we find a scale factor of 1.000896 ± 0.00036 for the altimetry-based GDTM.

We apply a Kolmogorov-Smirnov similarity test to OVIRS spectra of Bennu and laboratory spectra of minerals to categorize 3.4-μm features observed on Bennu as representing either carbonates or organics. Among the 15,585 spectra acquired by OVIRS during high-resolution (4 to 9 m/spectrum footprint) reconnaissance observations of select locations on Bennu's surface, we find 544 spectral matches with carbonates and 245 spectral matches with organics (total of 789 high-confidence spectral matches). We map the locations of these matches and characterize features of Bennu's surface using corresponding image data. Image data are used to quantitatively characterize the albedo within each spectrometer footprint. We find no apparent relationships between spectral classification and surface morphological expression, and we find no correlation between carbon species classification and other spectral properties such as slope or band depth. This suggests either that carbonates and organics are ubiquitous across the surface of Bennu, independent of surface features (consistent with findings from laboratory studies of carbonaceous chondrites), or that the observations do not have the spatial resolution required to resolve differences. However, we find more organic spectral matches at certain locations, including the site from which the OSIRIS-REx mission collected a sample, than at others. Higher concentrations of organics may be explained if these materials have been more recently exposed to surface alteration processes, perhaps by recent crater formation.",

Here, we study the impact of the OSIRIS-REx Touch-and-Go Sampling Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM) interacting with the surface of an asteroid in the framework of granular physics. Traditional approaches to estimating the penetration depth of a projectile into a granular medium include force laws and scaling relationships formulated from laboratory experiments in terrestrial-gravity conditions. However, it is unclear that these formulations extend to the OSIRIS-REx scenario of a 1300-kg spacecraft interacting with regolith in a microgravity environment. We studied the TAGSAM interaction with Bennu through numerical simulations using two collisional codes, PKDGRAV and GDC-I. We validated their accuracy by reproducing the results of laboratory impact experiments in terrestrial gravity. We then performed TAGSAM penetration simulations varying the following geotechnical properties of the regolith: packing fraction (P), bulk density, inter-particle cohesion (σ<SUB>c</SUB>), and angle of friction (ϕ). We find that the outcome of a spacecraft-regolith impact has a non-linear dependence on packing fraction. Closely packed regolith (P ≳ 0.6) can effectively resist the penetration of TAGSAM if ϕ ≳ 28° and/or σ<SUB>c</SUB> ≳ 50 Pa. For loosely packed regolith (P ≲ 0.5), the penetration depth is governed by a drag force that scales with impact velocity to the 4/3 power, consistent with energy conservation. We discuss the importance of low-speed impact studies for predicting and interpreting spacecraft-surface interactions. We show that these low-energy events also provide a framework for interpreting the burial depths of large boulders in asteroidal regolith.",

About 30% of these particles escape from Bennu, and the minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) between Bennu and Earth suggest the possibility of a \"Bennuid\" particle flux at Earth. We characterize the evolution of Bennu's particle stream and potential for meteor flux by simulating weekly particle ejections between the years 1780 and 2135 continuing their dynamical evolution until 2200. Ejections are modeled as a discrete release of 95 particles every week. The meteoroid stream is found to be fully distributed around Bennu's orbital path in 80±40 years. Individual particles and streams remain associable to Bennu for the entire 420 years simulated. Particle flux at Earth is predicted to begin in 2101, as the Bennu-Earth MOID reaches minimum values. The year of highest particle flux, 2182, experiences 161 Earth intersections and accounts for ∼1/4 of our predicted meteors. Our methods can be expanded to study the history and structure of the general meteoroid population and to estimate flux from specific near-Earth asteroids.",

In 2019, the OSIRIS-REx team selected primary and backup sample collection sites, called Nightingale and Osprey, respectively. On October 20, 2020, OSIRIS-REx successfully collected material from Nightingale. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning classification through the K-Means algorithm to spectrophotometrically characterize the surface of Bennu, and in particular Nightingale and Osprey. We first analyze a global mosaic of Bennu, from which we find four clusters scattered across the surface, reduced to three when we normalize the images at 550 nm. The three spectral clusters are associated with boulders and show significant differences in spectral slope and UV value. We do not see evidence of latitudinal non-uniformity, which suggests that Bennu's surface is well-mixed. In our higher-resolution analysis of the primary and backup sample sites, we find three representative normalized clusters, confirming an inverse correlation between reflectance and spectral slope (the darkest areas being the reddest ones) and between b' normalized reflectance and slope. Nightingale and Osprey are redder than the global surface of Bennu by more than 1σ from average, consistent with previous findings, with Nightingale being the reddest (S′ = (-0.3 ± 1.0) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> percent per thousand angstroms). We see hints of a weak absorption band at 550 nm at the candidate sample sites and globally, which lends support to the proposed presence of magnetite on Bennu.",

The spacecraft's instruments have characterized Bennu at global and local scales to select a sampling site and provide context for the sample that will be returned to Earth. These observations include thermal infrared spectral characterization by the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES). <BR /> Aims: To understand the degree of compositional and particle size variation on Bennu, and thereby predict the nature of the returned sample, we studied OTES spectra, which are diagnostic of these properties. <BR /> Methods: We created and mapped spectral indices and compared them with the distribution of geomorphic features. Comparison to laboratory spectra of aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites constrains the amount of compositional variability that is observable. <BR /> Results: The OTES spectra exhibit two end-member shapes (or types), and compositional variability appears limited at the spatial resolution of the observations. The global distribution of these spectral types corresponds with the locations of regions composed of (i) large, dark, relatively rough boulders and (ii) relatively smooth regions lacking large boulders. <BR /> Conclusions: The two spectral types appear to be diagnostic primarily of particle size variations, with contributions from other properties. The spectra resemble experimental data of solid substrates with very thin accumulations (a few to tens of microns) of fine particles (&lt;~65-100 μm). The dustier surfaces commonly correspond with rougher rocks that may produce and/or act as traps for the particles. Anhydrous silicates are limited in abundance, and the bulk mineralogy is consistent with the most aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites. We expect the returned samples to include these physical and mineralogical characteristics.",

Here we investigate the global photometric properties of Bennu as observed by the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer (OVIRS) over the time period December 9, 2018, to September 26, 2019. In this study we used observations obtained over wavelengths ranging from 0.4 to 3.7 μm, with a solar phase angle range of 5.3° to 132.6°. Our aim is to characterize the global average disk-resolved photometric properties of Bennu with multiple models. The best-fit model is a McEwen model with an exponential phase function and an exponential polynomial partition function. We use this model to correct the OVIRS spectra of Bennu to a standard reference viewing and illumination geometry at visible to infrared wavelengths for the purposes of global spectral mapping. We derive a bolometric Bond albedo map in which Bennu's surface values range from 0.021 to 0.027. We find a phase reddening effect, and our model is effective at removing this phase reddening. Our average model albedo shows a blueish spectrum with a &gt; 10% absorption feature centered at 2.74 μm. Of all comparisons with previously visited asteroids and comets, only 28P/Neujmin, 2P/Encke, and (162173) Ryugu are darker than Bennu. We find that Bennu is a few percent brighter than Ryugu in the wavelengths respectively observed by the OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions (from 0.48 to 0.86 μm). We also compare our spectroscopic photometry of Bennu with the OSIRIS-REx imaging photometry and with ground-based predictions.",

      "abstract": "The surfaces of airless bodies such as lunar and S-type asteroids typically become spectrally redder in visible to near-infrared reflectance with longer exposures to space weathering. However, some carbonaceous asteroids instead become spectrally bluer. Space weathering experiments on carbonaceous meteorites have provided some clues as to the space weathering products that could produce spectral bluing. We applied these experimental results to our Hapke radiative transfer model, with which we modeled spectral data from the OSIRIS-REx mission in order to determine whether these space weathering products—specifically, nanophase and microphase metallic iron, troilite, and magnetite—could explain the globally blue spectrum of the carbonaceous asteroid (101955) Bennu. The model suggests that the surface of Bennu has microphase iron, nanophase magnetite, and nanophase and microphase troilite. Considering previous space weathering experiments together with our spectral modeling of Bennu, we posit that the presence of nanophase magnetite is what causes a carbonaceous asteroid to become spectrally bluer with exposure time. Nanophase magnetite can form on asteroids that have Fe-bearing hydrated minerals (phyllosilicates). On anhydrous carbonaceous asteroids, nanophase iron forms instead of magnetite, leading to spectral reddening. We therefore predict that samples returned by the OSIRIS-REx mission from Bennu will have more nanophase magnetite than nanophase iron with nanophase and microphase sulfides, whereas samples returned by the Hayabusa2 mission from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu, which is spectrally red, will contain nanophase and microphase sulfides as well as more nanophase iron than nanophase magnetite.",

The SPC shape models were used for operational planning, navigation, sample site selection, and initial scientific investigations. To this end, detailed analyses of the quality of each shape model and a thorough documentation of all sources of error were vital to ensure proper considerations of the limitations of each model. In this paper, we present methods used during the OSIRIS-REx mission to validate the SPC shape models and construct the associated quality reports.

Using PolyCam panchromatic images, we constructed a globally controlled basemap of Bennu at an approximate ground sample distance of 5 cm with a mean spatial accuracy of ~30 cm. The basemap was photometrically normalized using a Minneart phase angle correction. New mapping methods were developed to combine images of Bennu's irregular shape and extremely rough surface into a nearly seamless mosaic.

Our study was conducted before the spacecraft arrived at the mission target asteroid (101955) Bennu, and we used observational sequence plans of the OSIRIS REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer (OVIRS). We explored six methods of mapping data to shape model facets, using three spatial resolutions. We attempted to boost map fidelity by increasing the observational coverage of the surface. We find that increasing shape model resolution improves mapping quality. However, once the shape model's mean facet edge length is smaller than two fifths of the diameter of the instrument's field of view (FOV), the increase in quality tapers off. The six mapping methods can be broken into two categories: facets that (1) select or (2) combine (average) data from observations. The quality differences between similar averaging methods (clipped average, weighted average, etc.) are insignificant. Selecting the nearest observation to a facet best preserves an enclosed outcrop's shape and signal, but averaging spots are more conservative against errors in photometric modeling. A completely enclosed outcrop border expands into the surrounding region by 0.8-1.5 radii of the instrument's FOV. Regions smaller than the instrument's FOV are present in resulting maps; however, their signal strength is reduced as a function of their size relative to the instrument FOV.",

Our goal is to define optical roughness and other scattering parameters that may be useful for the laboratory preparation of sample analogs, interpretation of imaging data, and analysis of the sample that will be returned to Earth. We rely on a semi-numerical statistical model aided by digital terrain model (DTM) shadow ray-tracing to obtain scattering parameters at the smallest surface element allowed by the DTM (facets of ~10 cm). Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, we solved the inversion problem on all four-band images of the OSIRIS-REx mission' s top four candidate sample sites, for which high-precision laser altimetry DTMs are available. We reconstructed the a posteriori probability distribution for each parameter and distinguished primary and secondary solutions. Through the photometric image correction, we found that a mixing of low and average roughness slope best describes Bennu's surface for up to 90<SUP>∘</SUP> phase angle. We detected a low non-zero specular ratio, perhaps indicating exposed sub-centimeter mono-crystalline inclusions on the surface. We report an average roughness RMS slope of 27<SUB>-5</SUB><SUP>∘+1</SUP>, a specular ratio of 2.6<SUB>-0.8</SUB><SUP>+0.1</SUP>%, an approx. single-scattering albedo of 4.64<SUB>-0.09</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP>% at 550 nm, and two solutions for the back-scatter asymmetric factor, ξ<SUP>(1)</SUP> = - 0.360 ± 0.030 and ξ<SUP>(2)</SUP> = - 0.444 ± 0.020, for all four sites altogether.",

      "abstract": "The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission will collect material from the asteroid Bennu and return it to Earth. The sample collection method uses pressurized nitrogen gas to mobilize regolith. It is likely that the gas will mobilize more, potentially much more, material than is captured by the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM) for return. The amount, velocities, and fate of this mobilized material have important implications for our understanding of Bennu's physical properties and processes, such as impact cratering, regolith mobility, and the recently observed natural ejection of particles. The nature of the TAGSAM-ejected material is also significant for mission operations. We conducted numerical simulations and ground-based tests to estimate the amount and speeds of material mobilized by the sampling event. The estimated ejected masses range from 12 kg to &gt;165 kg; given that Bennu appears to be a nearly strengthless rubble pile, the higher end of the mass range is more likely. Maximum ejection speeds for 1-cm-diameter particles could reach 10 m/s; smaller particles will be ejected at faster speeds. Minimum ejection speeds will be determined by the as yet unknown cohesive strength of Bennu's regolith. Material ejected more slowly than 10 cm/s will reaccrete on Bennu; material ejected between 10 and 30 cm/s may or may not reaccrete; and material ejected faster than 30 cm/s will escape. Some of the ejected material is predicted to remain in transient orbits around Bennu. The lifetimes of these orbits span from days to several weeks, the maximum duration of our integrations. Reaccreted material should be concentrated in a region near the sample site, although re-impacts will occur globally. Gas from TAGSAM will mobilize material beyond the contact perimeter; because of interactions between cohesion and microgravity, there is a preferred particle size of mobility, predicted to be tens of centimeters, depending on the TAG latitude. Observing Bennu during and after the sampling event will make it possible to test these predictions and understand how the asteroid responds to disruption and particle mobility across the surface.",

PolyCam acquired high-resolution images (nadir pixel scale of ~6.25 cm/pixel) of the surface from the equator to mid-latitudes (~ ± 50°) at a low phase angle (~8°). We applied specialized charge smear and radiometric correction to the data to compensate for image artifacts stemming from very short exposure times. We photogrammetrically controlled the images to shape model tiles with a 5-cm ground sample distance to register the images to each other and to ground. Variations in albedo on Bennu's globally dark surface (median albedo of 0.046 ± 0.002) are associated with clusters of dark and bright boulders, as well as a much sparser population of meter-scale boulders with very high reflectances (albedo &gt;0.10). Accordingly, Bennu has a relatively broad albedo-frequency distribution (~25% full width at half maximum) with a long tail toward higher values. Owing to the distribution of the dark boulders and boulder clusters, the southern hemisphere of Bennu is darker than the northern hemisphere; this hemispheric dichotomy varies with longitude, resulting in a large-scale diagonal pattern in albedo across the full disk of Bennu.",

We suggest that Bennu's parent body formed in the outer solar system before it was perturbed into the asteroid belt and then evolved into a near-Earth object. We show that this is consistent with models of planetesimal evolution. Bennu has many characteristics expected for a dormant comet, and could potentially contain a minimum of 1 wt.% adsorbed water if its gross mineralogy is consistent with the Orgueil meteorite. This is in addition to any ice or water contained within the hydrous minerals themselves. Based on this hypothesis, we predict the properties of the samples that will be returned to Earth by the OSIRIS-REx mission, including abundant phyllosilicate minerals, amorphous hydrated silicates and low-density, very high-porosity aggregates, already observed by the OSIRIS-REx instrument suite. We predict enrichments in D/H and <SUP>15</SUP>N/<SUP>14</SUP>N, high C/Mg ratios (&gt;∼7 wt%), and a greater range of organic compositions than found in meteorites, including an organic component poor in aromatics, and a more labile organic fraction.

The presence of hydrated phyllosilicates and iron oxides indicates substantial aqueous alteration in Bennu's past. <BR /> Conclusions: Bennu's spectra are not identical to a limited set of carbonaceous chondrite spectra, possibly due to compositional properties and spatial scale differences; however, returned samples should contain a mixture of common chondrite materials.",

The NASA mission OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) has been observing near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu in close proximity since December 2018. In October 2020, the spacecraft collected a sample of surface material from Bennu to return to Earth. <BR /> Aims: In this work, we investigate spectral phase reddening - that is, the variation of spectral slope with phase angle - on Bennu using spectra acquired by the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer (OVIRS) covering a phase angle range of 8-130°. We investigate this process at the global scale and for some localized regions of interest (ROIs), including boulders, craters, and the designated sample collection sites of the OSIRIS-REx mission. <BR /> Methods: Spectra were wavelength- and flux-calibrated, then corrected for the out-of-band contribution and thermal emission, resampled, and finally converted into radiance factor per standard OVIRS processing. Spectral slopes were computed in multiple wavelength ranges from spectra normalized at 0.55 μm. <BR /> Results: Bennu has a globally negative spectra slope, which is typical of B-type asteroids. The spectral slope gently increases in a linear way up to a phase angle of 90°, where it approaches zero. The spectral phase reddening is monotonic and wavelength-dependent with highest values in the visible range. Its coefficient is 0.00044 μm<SUP>-1</SUP> deg<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 0.55-2.5 μm range. For observations of Bennu acquired at high phase angle (130°), phase reddening increases exponentially, and the spectral slope becomes positive. Similar behavior was reported in the literature for the carbonaceous chondrite Mukundpura in spectra acquired at extreme geometries. Some ROIs, including the sample collection site, Nightingale, have a steeper phase reddening coefficient than the global average, potentially indicating a surface covered by fine material with high micro-roughness. <BR /> Conclusions: The gentle spectral phase reddening effect on Bennu is similar to that observed in ground-based measurements of other B-type asteroids, but much lower than that observed for other low-albedo bodies such as Ceres or comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Monotonic reddening may be associated with the presence of fine particles at micron scales and/or of particles with fractal structure that introduce micro- and sub-micro roughness across the surface of Bennu.",

The Altimetry Working Group (AltWG) generates digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential for assessing the sampleability and science value of potential sample sites. The AltWG uses stereophotoclinometry (SPC) to generate these DTMs from images collected by the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite. We built and evaluated an SPC-derived DTM by performing a flight-like test, using images (0.4-3 cm per pixel) of a physical test wall constructed to simulate a 3 m × 3 m portion of Bennu's surface. We built the DTM using images acquired under similar lighting conditions to those planned for the OSIRIS-REx mission and processed them using flight-like SPC procedures. The results were compared to measurements of the wall obtained using a laser altimeter. We found maximum height differences between the SPC-derived model and the altimetric data of -2.6 and 3.4 cm (or 13-17% of the dynamic range of the heights across the wall), specifically around large surface rocks. For the majority of the SPC-derived model, differences are less than ± 0.5 cm (&lt;2.5% of the dynamic range of the heights across the wall) or ~1.5× the images' best pixel scale of 0.4 cm. In the spatial frequency domain, spectral correlation and coherency assessments comparing the SPC-derived model and the altimetric data show that the SPC-generated DTMs are an excellent product from wavelengths of ~3 m down to shorter wavelengths of ~0.1 m. Cross-correlation assessment of images rendered from the SPC-derived model vs. images of the test wall further show that our models accurately reproduce the combined albedo and surface shape, with cross-correlation scores &gt;0.65.",

      "abstract": "The CM carbonaceous chondrites have all been aqueously altered, and some of them were subsequently heated in a parent body environment. Here we have sought to understand the impact of short duration heating on a highly aqueously altered CM through laboratory experiments on Allan Hills (ALH) 83100. Unheated ALH 83100 contains 83 volume per cent serpentine within the fine-grained matrix and altered chondrules. The matrix also hosts grains of calcite and dolomite, which are often intergrown with tochilinite, Fe(Ni) sulphides (pyrrhotite, pentlandite), magnetite and organic matter. Some of the magnetite formed by replacement of Fe(Ni) sulphides that were accreted from the nebula. Laboratory heating to 400 °C has caused partial dehydroxylation of serpentine and loss of isotopically light oxygen leading to an increase in bulk δ<SUP>18</SUP>O and fall in Δ<SUP>17</SUP>O. Tochilinite has decomposed to magnetite, whereas carbonates have remained unaltered. With regards to infrared spectroscopy (4000–400 cm<SUP>‑1</SUP>; 2.5–25 µm), heating to 400 °C has resulted in decreased emissivity (increased reflectance), a sharper and more symmetric OH band at 3684 cm<SUP>‑1</SUP> (2.71 µm), a broadening of the SiO stretching band together with movement of its minimum to longer wavenumbers, and a decreasing depth of the MgOH band (625 cm<SUP>‑1</SUP>; 16 µm). The SiO bending band is unmodified by mild heating. With heating to 800 °C the serpentine has fully dehydroxylated and recrystallized to ∼Fo<SUB>60/70</SUB> olivine. Bulk δ<SUP>18</SUP>O has further increased and Δ<SUP>17</SUP>O decreased. Troilite and pyrrhotite have formed, and recrystallization of pentlandite has produced Fe,Ni metal. Calcite and dolomite were calcined at ∼700 °C and in their place is an un-named Ca-Fe oxysulphide. Heating changes the structural order of organic matter so that Raman spectroscopy of carbon in the 800 °C sample shows an increased (D1 + D4) proportional area parameter. The infrared spectrum of the 800 °C sample confirms the abundance of Fe-bearing olivine and is very similar to the spectrum of naturally heated stage IV CM Pecora Escarpment 02010. The temperature-related mineralogical, chemical, isotopic and spectroscopic signatures defined in ALH 83100 will help to track the post-hydration thermal histories of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, and samples returned from the primitive asteroids Ryugu and Bennu.",

Five distinct spectral groups are identified at a 2σ confidence level. At a higher confidence level of 3σ, no grouping is observed. <BR /> Conclusions: The results at a 2σ confidence level distinguish a dominant spectral behavior group (group 1, background) and four small groups showing spectral slope variations, associated with areas with different surface properties. The background group contains most of the analyzed data, which implies a globally homogeneous surface at the spectral and spatial resolution of the data. The small groups with redder spectra are concentrated around the equatorial ridge and are associated with morphological surface features such as specific craters and boulders. No significant variation is detected in the band area or depth of the 2.74 μm band, which is associated with hydrated phyllosilicate content. The spectral slope variations are interpreted as a consequence of different regolith particle sizes, and/or porosity, and/or space weathering, that is, the presence of more or less fresh material. The OSIRIS-REx mission primary sampling site, Nightingale, and a boulder known as the Roc, are redder than the background surface.",

Thousands of images will be acquired by the MapCam instrument onboard the spacecraft, an imager with four color filters based on the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey (ECAS): b‧ (473 nm), v (550 nm), w (698 nm), and x (847 nm). This set of filters will allow identification and characterization of the absorption band centered at 700 nm and associated with hydrated silicates. In this work, we present and validate a spectral clustering methodology for application to the upcoming MapCam images of the surface of Bennu. Our procedure starts with the projection, calibration, and photometric correction of the images. In a second step, we apply a K-means algorithm and we use the Elbow criterion to identify natural clusters. This methodology allows us to find distinct areas with spectral similarities, which are characterized by parameters such as the spectral slope S‧ and the center and depth of the 700-nm absorption band, if present. We validate this methodology using images of (1) Ceres from NASA's Dawn mission. In particular, we analyze the Occator crater and Ahuna Mons. We identify one spectral cluster-located in the outer parts of the Occator crater interior-showing the 700-nm hydration band centered at 698 ± 7 nm and with a depth of 3.4 ± 1.0%. We interpret this finding in the context of the crater's near-surface geology.",

Mission success hinges on identifying a site that is safe and has regolith that can readily be ingested by the spacecraft's sampling mechanism. To inform this mission-critical decision, the surface of Bennu is mapped using the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite and the images are used to develop several foundational data products. Acquiring the necessary inputs to these data products requires observational strategies that are defined specifically to overcome the challenges associated with mapping a small irregular body. We present these strategies in the context of assessing candidate sample sites at Bennu according to a framework of decisions regarding the relative safety, sampleability, and scientific value across the asteroid's surface. To create data products that aid these assessments, we describe the best practices developed by the OSIRIS-REx team for image-based mapping of irregular small bodies. We emphasize the importance of using 3-D shape models and the ability to work in body-fixed rectangular coordinates when dealing with planetary surfaces that cannot be uniquely addressed by body-fixed latitude and longitude.",

OTES is a Fourier Transform spectrometer covering the spectral range 5.71-100 μm (1750-100 cm^{-1}) with a spectral sample interval of 8.66 cm^{-1} and a 6.5-mrad field of view. The OTES telescope is a 15.2-cm diameter Cassegrain telescope that feeds a flat-plate Michelson moving mirror mounted on a linear voice-coil motor assembly. A single uncooled deuterated l-alanine doped triglycine sulfate (DLATGS) pyroelectric detector is used to sample the interferogram every two seconds. Redundant ∼0.855 μm laser diodes are used in a metrology interferometer to provide precise moving mirror control and IR sampling at 772 Hz. The beamsplitter is a 38-mm diameter, 1-mm thick chemical vapor deposited diamond with an antireflection microstructure to minimize surface reflection. An internal calibration cone blackbody target provides radiometric calibration. The radiometric precision in a single spectrum is ≤2.2 × 10^{-8} W cm^{-2} sr ^{-1}/cm^{-1} between 300 and 1350 cm^{-1}. The absolute integrated radiance error is &lt;1% for scene temperatures ranging from 150 to 380 K. The overall OTES envelope size is 37.5 × 28.9 × 52.2 cm, and the mass is 6.27 kg. The power consumption is 10.8 W average. OTES was developed by Arizona State University with Moog Broad Reach developing the electronics. OTES was integrated, tested, and radiometrically calibrated on the Arizona State University campus in Tempe, AZ.",

      "abstract": "Recent research on the Himalayan cryosphere has increasingly been focused on climate uncertainty and regional variations, considering features such as glacier recession, lake expansion, outburst floods, and regional hazards. The Bhilangana river basin, located in the central Himalayas, is predominantly characterized by increased elevation-dependent warming and declining seasonal precipitation. Our study shows that high-elevation temperature increased from 2000 to 2022 (0.05 °C/year, p = &lt; 0.05), which resulted in rapid frontal glacier retreat and expansion of glacier lakes. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to process satellite, reanalysis, and observational data records with descriptive and nonparametric statistical methods. Most of the debris-covered glaciers in this valley exhibited a significant rate of retreat in the last two decades (averaging 31 m per year), although the debris-free Masar glacier retreated even faster (49 m per year). In all, 13 glacier lakes were demarcated and intensively investigated at multi-temporal scales together with variations in area, volume, depth, and discharge at different geomorphologic locations. Maximum changes were detected in the land-terminated lake, which exhibited a significant increase in area (13,398 to 360,878 m<SUP>2</SUP>), volume (75,406 to 8,099,363 m<SUP>3</SUP>), depth (5.6 to 22.4 m), and discharge (13.3 to 304.6 m/sec) and is considered susceptible to a future flood event. In addition, unsteady flow estimation modeling was employed to describe peak discharge, depth, and velocity associated with regional flood extent over four distinctive simulation scenarios. Maximum peak discharge during the lake outburst is predicted to exceed 4500 m<SUP>3</SUP>/sec along with increased maximum water depth in the lower plains (44.2 m) and significantly elevated velocity (&gt; 20 m/sec). Quantification of the regional hazard reveals potentially severe downstream challenges for low-to-medium-scale hydropower stations, local settlements, and road and railway bridges near Devling and Ghuttu villages.",

The cloud distribution obtained is in good agreement with in situ observations by Pioneer Venus and remote-sensing observations from Venus Express (VEx). Case studies were conducted to investigate sensitivities to atmospheric parameters, including eddy diffusion and temperature profiles. We find that efficient eddy transport is important for determining upper haze population and its microphysical properties. Using the recently updated eddy diffusion coefficient profile by Mahieux et al., our model replicates the observed upper haze distribution. The H<SUB>2</SUB>O vapor distribution is highly sensitive to the eddy diffusion coefficient in the 60–70 km region. This indicates that updating the eddy diffusion coefficient is crucial for understanding the H<SUB>2</SUB>O vapor transport through the cloud layer. The H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> vapor abundance varies by several orders of magnitude above 85 km, depending on the temperature profile. However, its maximum value aligns well with observational upper limits found by Sandor et al., pointing to potential sources other than H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB> aerosols in the upper haze layer that contribute to the SO<SUB>2</SUB> inversion layer. The best-fit eddy diffusion profile is determined to be ∼2 m<SUP>2</SUP> s<SUP>‑1</SUP> between 60 and 70 km and ∼360 m<SUP>2</SUP> s<SUP>‑1</SUP> above 85 km.

More than 19,000 extensional lineaments (grabens, fissures and fractures) were mapped in the area 13°-26°E, 0°-10°N, at 1:500,000 scale using full resolution Magellan SAR (radar) images. These structures are interpreted to represent the surface expression of underlying mafic dykes and have been grouped, on the basis of trend, into radiating, circumferential and linear dyke swarms. Thirty-two swarms are identified and linked to 20 magmatic centres, most of which are located within or near two coronae, Belet-ili and Gaia (Gaya) coronae, while others are linked to magmatic centres outside the study area. These magmatic centres are interpreted to be linked to underlying mantle plumes, and the sizes of the underlying flattened plume heads are estimated from the interpreted dyke swarms: for radiating swarms, the radius of the transition from proximal radiating to more distal linear pattern, and for circumferential dykes, the radial distance to the outer boundary of the circumferential pattern. Plume heads for the largest centres, Belet-ili and Gaia coronae are estimated at about 230 km and 275 km in radius, respectively. These sizes are less than the 1200 km radii predicted for a plume arriving from the deep mantle, and would suggest an origin at a shallower level (likely a mid-mantle boundary, i.e. between upper and lower mantle). The NW alignment of Belet-ili and Gaia corona and other magmatic centres in our study area potentially represents structural control by a rift zone, which can be traced further north to Anala Mons (one of two main plume centres of Central Eistla Regio).",

The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated<SUP>1-7</SUP>. However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1-EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2-compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations, TET2 mutation or elevated DNMT3A expression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies.",

Primary culture and fresh isolation of brain mural cells demonstrate bicarbonate-induced, GPR30-dependent calcium responses.

Collectively, we identify a bicarbonate-sensing GPCR in brain mural cells that regulates blood flow and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our results provide a perspective on the modulation of GPR30 signalling in the development of innovative therapies for ischaemic stroke. Moreover, our findings provide perspectives on acid/base sensing GPCRs, concomitantly modulating cellular responses depending on fluctuating ion concentrations under the acid-base homoeostasis.",

Quantitative analysis reveals that errors in the 1D-PCM, with deviations of 1 to 2 km in hmV<SUB>2</SUB> and 5%-10% difference in nmV<SUB>2</SUB> between the model and observations, could be due to uncertainties in the neutral density and solar flux models.

A two-fluid analytic model of the shock front structure was derived under the assumptions that the shock is stationary and planar. The ion and electron kinetic pressures were assumed to be scalar, and polytropic state equations were used. The results of this analytical approach show that the shock magnetic field has an oscillatory structure. Venus Express (VEX) observations of the Venusian bow shock have been used to validate these theoretical findings. The Venusian bow shock and corresponding foreshock are significantly smaller than those of Earth. Thus, observations of the underlying structure of the quasi-parallel shock at Venus are not masked by the presence of high-amplitude waves and nonlinear structures originating in the foreshock. It is shown that the structure of the shock front, as observed by VEX, has a very strong similarity to the structure obtained analytically.",

      "abstract": "Surface mineralogy records the primary composition, climate history and the geochemical cycling between the surface and atmosphere. We have not yet directly measured mineralogy on the Venus surface in situ, but a variety of independent investigations yield a basic understanding of surface composition and weathering reactions in the present era where rocks react under a supercritical atmosphere dominated by CO<SUB>2</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB> and SO<SUB>2</SUB> at ∼460 °C and 92 bars. The primary composition of the volcanic plains that cover ∼80% of the surface is inferred to be basaltic, as measured by the 7 Venera and Vega landers and consistent with morphology. These landers also recorded elevated SO<SUB>3</SUB> values, low rock densities and spectral signatures of hematite consistent with chemical weathering under an oxidizing environment. Thermodynamic modeling and laboratory experiments under present day atmospheric conditions predict and demonstrate reactions where Fe, Ca, Na in rocks react primarily with S species to form sulfates, sulfides and oxides. Variations in surface emissivity at ∼1 μm detected by the VIRTIS instrument on the Venus Express orbiter are spatially correlated to geologic terrains. Laboratory measurements of the near-infrared (NIR) emissivity of geologic materials at Venus surface temperatures confirms theoretical predictions that 1 μm emissivity is directly related to Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> content in minerals. These data reveal regions of high emissivity that may indicate unweathered and recently erupted basalts and low emissivity associated with tessera terrain that may indicate felsic materials formed during a more clement era. Magellan radar emissivity also constrain mineralogy as this parameter is inversely related to the type and volume of high dielectric minerals, likely to have formed due to surface/atmosphere reactions. The observation of both viscous and low viscosity volcanic flows in Magellan images may also be related to composition. The global NIR emissivity and high-resolution radar and topography collected by the VERITAS, EnVision and DAVINCI missions will provide a revolutionary advancement of these methods and our understanding of Venus mineralogy. Critically, these datasets must be supported with both laboratory experiments to constrain the style and rate weathering reactions and laboratory measurements of their NIR emissivity and radar characteristics at Venus conditions.",

The distributions of magnetosheath field clock angle illustrate the nearly symmetric morphology of draped magnetic field with respect to the solar wind electric field, and the departure of the IMF clock angle is larger at closer distances. Based on VEX data, the sheath field clock angle departures are found to be &lt;45 degrees for 90% of the instances under steady IMF and this parameter can respond almost immediately to the unsteady IMF. We suggest the magnetosheath field just slips around the planet without significant pileup or bending. Our time-dependent simulations indicate that the response time of sheath field to IMF variation is not more than 1 min and it depends on the involved regions of magnetosheath: the timescale in the inner part of magnetosheath adjacent to the induced magnetosphere is longer than that in the outer part. We find this timescale is controlled by the convection velocity in the magnetosheath, emphasizing the magnetohydrodynamic characteristics of the behavior of the sheath field. The finite magnetosheath field clock angle departure and its quick response to IMF variation suggest that the magnetic field clock angle measured within the Venusian magnetosheath can be used as a reasonable proxy for the upstream IMF clock angle.",

The regions of the induced magnetosphere are separated by plasma boundaries, where their shapes and sizes are influenced by variations in the surrounding environment. Investigations of the boundaries and their variability can help us understand the solar wind's effect on Venus and unmagnetized planets in general. In this study, the bow shock and ion composition boundary locations are investigated using, for the first time, the full data set of plasma and magnetic field measurements by Venus Express taken during 2006-2014. The locations of the boundaries are examined with respect to upstream conditions and the solar cycle. We find, in agreement with previous studies using Pioneer Venus Orbiter measurements, that the bow shock location is mostly sensitive to the solar cycle and the dynamic pressure and that it exhibits asymmetries in the terminator plane, depending on the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field. The asymmetries are mainly attributed to the asymmetry in the pickup ion distribution and thus mass loading in the magnetosheath. The ion composition boundary on the dayside is found to decrease in altitude with increasing dynamic pressure during solar maximum (2006-2011), but shows no clear trends during solar minimum (2011-2014) conditions.",

      "abstract": "Despite the growing importance of planetary Space Weather forecasting and radiation protection for science and robotic exploration and the need for accurate Space Weather monitoring and predictions, only a limited number of spacecraft have dedicated instrumentation for this purpose. However, every spacecraft (planetary or astronomical) has hundreds of housekeeping sensors distributed across the spacecraft, some of which can be useful to detect radiation hazards produced by solar particle events. In particular, energetic particles that impact detectors and subsystems on a spacecraft can be identified by certain housekeeping sensors, such as the Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) memory counters, and their effects can be assessed. These counters typically have a sudden large increase in a short time in their error counts that generally match the arrival of energetic particles to the spacecraft. We investigate these engineering datasets for scientific purposes and perform a feasibility study of solar energetic particle event detections using EDAC counters from seven European Space Agency Solar System missions: Venus Express, Mars Express, ExoMars-Trace Gas Orbiter, Rosetta, BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter, and Gaia. Six cases studies, in which the same event was observed by different missions at different locations in the inner Solar System are analyzed. The results of this study show how engineering sensors, for example, EDAC counters, can be used to infer information about the solar particle environment at each spacecraft location. Therefore, we demonstrate the potential of the various EDAC to provide a network of solar particle detections at locations where no scientific observations of this kind are available.",

PMS events are identified in the majority (around 93%) of the postshock 2 hr regions, with transit times ranging from 10 to 120 minutes, which demonstrates their common occurrence associated with ICME-driven shocks. About 33% of the detected PMS events cover the whole 2 hr intervals, called full PMS events. Most of the full PMS events are observed in the downstream region of quasi-perpendicular shocks. In addition, statistical results show that full PMS events occurring in the downstream region of quasi-perpendicular shocks are generally associated with higher magnetic compression ratios, which implies that full PMS events are more likely to be formed in the downstream region of strong quasi-perpendicular shocks.",

For that purpose, we have implemented a state-of-the-art photochemical and equilibrium cloud model in the Venus Planetary Climate Model (Venus PCM). The interactive coupling between dynamics, radiation, chemistry and clouds allows a comprehensive description of the CO<SUB>2</SUB>, CO, sulfur, chlorine, oxygen, and hydrogen species, with tracking of the condensed phase. Regarding the clouds, the Venus PCM calculates the composition, number density, and sedimentation rates of the binary H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>-H<SUB>2</SUB>O liquid aerosols, based on observed altitude-dependent size distributions. The article describes in detail the new components implemented in the Venus PCM. It then presents an overview of the results concerning clouds and atmospheric chemistry, which are compared with a wide range of observations. The modeled cloud characteristics and vertical profiles of minor species are found to be in broad agreement with most of the measurements available between 30 and 100 km. In particular, the Venus PCM reproduces the steep decrease of H<SUB>2</SUB>O and SO<SUB>2</SUB> mixing ratio inside the cloud layer, as well as the observed vertical distribution of species well identified above the clouds, such as CO and O<SUB>3</SUB>. The model also agrees with the ground-based measurements of HCl, but not with the conflicting HCl vertical profiles derived from Venus Express. On the quasi-horizontal plane, latitudinal contrasts in the modeled trace species mostly result from the Hadley-type mean meridional circulation. Large-scale longitudinal variations are essentially created by the diurnal thermal tide above the clouds, and by photolysis above 80 km.",

Volcanism is clearly a major, widespread process on Venus, and is a principal expression of the planet's secular loss of interior heat. Without sufficient in situ data to clearly determine its internal structure, we can use the morphological and spatial properties of volcanoes across the planet to help place constraints on our understanding of the volcanic characteristics and history of Venus. With the Magellan synthetic-aperture radar full-resolution radar map left- and right-look global mosaics at 75 m-per-pixel resolution, we developed a global catalog of volcanoes on Venus that contains ∼85,000 edifices, ∼99% of which are &lt;5 km in diameter. We find that Venus hosts far more volcanoes than previously mapped, and that although they are distributed across virtually the entire planet, size-frequency distribution analysis reveals a relative lack of edifices in the 20-100 km diameter range, which could be related to magma availability and eruption rate. Through spatial density analysis of volcanoes alongside assessments of geophysical data sets and proximal tectonic and volcanic structures, we report on the morphological and spatial patterns of volcanism on Venus to help gain new insights into the planet's geological evolution.",

An escaping plume is formed by pickup oxygen ions in the hemisphere where the motional electric field points outward from Venus, while the velocity of solar wind protons is faster in the opposite hemisphere. The pickup O<SUP>+</SUP> escape rate is estimated to be (3.6 ± 1.4) × 10<SUP>24</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> at solar maximum, which is comparable to the ion loss rate through the magnetotail, and (1.3 ± 0.4) × 10<SUP>24</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> at solar minimum. The increase of O<SUP>+</SUP> fluxes with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) intensity is significant upstream of the bow shock, partially attributed to the increase of exospheric neutral oxygen density. However, the solar wind velocity just has a slight effect on the pickup O<SUP>+</SUP> escape rate in the magnetosheath, while the effect of solar wind density is not observed.

      "abstract": "Recent simulations of the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL) Venus Global Climate Model (VGCM) developed at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD) were performed with a model top raised from ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> (∼150 km) to ∼10<SUP>-8</SUP> Pa (180-250 km; upper boundary). The parameterizations of non-LTE CO<SUB>2</SUB> near infrared heating rates and of non-orographic gravity waves were improved. In addition, a tuning of atomic oxygen production was introduced to improve related effects (heating and cooling) and resulting thermospheric number densities. This work focusses on validating the modelled thermospheric structure using data from the Pioneer Venus, Magellan and Venus Express missions which cover similar and complementary (equator and pole) regions at different periods of solar activity, typically above altitudes of 130 km. This version of the IPSL VGCM shows good agreement with the diurnal evolution of the exospheric temperature at the equator reconstructed from the atomic oxygen scale height of the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Neutral Mass Spectrometer data. The model is also able to reproduce the sensitivity of the exospheric temperature and species density to the EUV flux of the solar high activity period (from 180 to 230 solar flux unit; s.f.u). However, to fit with the PV-ONMS density observations, it was necessary to increase the photodissociation of CO<SUB>2</SUB> into CO and O above 135 km by a factor of 10. Indeed, our study points to the importance of an additional source of oxygen and carbon monoxide production above 130 km other than CO<SUB>2</SUB> photolysis to explain the vertical profiles of CO and O number density in the thermosphere. Moreover, the presence of a GW drag at altitudes above 140 km has a significant impact on the nightside temperature value and its distribution.",

This paper describes the methods and the required calibrations applied to VEX-VeRa raw radio occultation data used to retrieve vertical profiles of Venus' ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. In this work we perform an independent analysis of a set of 25 VEX, single-frequency (X-band), occultations carried out in 2014, recorded in open-loop at the NASA Deep Space Network. Our temperature, pressure and electron density vertical profiles are in agreement with previous studies available in the literature. Furthermore, our analysis shows that Venus' ionosphere is more influenced by the day/night condition than the latitude variations, while the neutral atmosphere experiences the opposite. Our scientific interpretation of these results is based on two major responsible effects: Venus' high thermal inertia and the zonal winds. Their presence within Venus' neutral atmosphere determine why in these regions a latitude dependence is predominant on the day/night condition. On the contrary, at higher altitudes the two aforementioned effects are less important or null, and Venus' ionosphere shows higher electron density peaks in the probed day-time occultations, regardless of the latitude.",

Using the background counts from MCPs on the Mars Express and Venus Express orbiters-operating over 17 yr and 8 yr, respectively-we investigated the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) characteristics of the inner solar system. The MCP background counts at Mars and Venus, on a solar cycle timescale, exhibited clear anticorrelation with the sunspot number. We concluded that the measured MCP background counts contained GCR information. The GCR characteristics measured using the MCP background counts at Mars showed features consistent with measurements on Earth in Solar Cycle 24. The time lag between the sunspot number and the MCP background counts was found to be ~9 months at Mars. The shorter-term background data recorded along the orbits (with a timescale of several hours) also showed evident depletion of the background counts, due to absorption of the GCR particles by the planets. Thanks to the visible planetary size change along an orbit, we developed a model to separate the GCR contribution to the MCP background counts from the internal contribution caused by the β-decay of radioactive elements in the MCP glass. Our statistical analysis of the GCR absorption signatures at Mars implies that the effective absorption radius of Mars for the GCR particles is &gt;100 km larger than the radius of the planet. However, the cause remains an open question.",

In most flowering plants, formation of the female germline is initiated with specification of one megaspore mother cell (MMC) in each ovule; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this key event remains unclear. Here we report that spatially restricted auxin signaling promotes MMC fate in Arabidopsis. Our results show that the microRNA160 (miR160) targeted gene ARF17 (AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR17) is required for promoting MMC specification by genetically interacting with the SPL/NZZ (SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE) gene. Alterations of auxin signaling cause formation of supernumerary MMCs in an ARF17- and SPL/NZZ-dependent manner. Furthermore, miR160 and ARF17 are indispensable for attaining a normal auxin maximum at the ovule apex via modulating the expression domain of PIN1 (PIN-FORMED1) auxin transporter. Our findings elucidate the mechanism by which auxin signaling promotes the acquisition of female germline cell fate in plants.",

Previously, we showed that the ICD-bound transmembrane protein 65 (Tmem65) was required for connexin43 (Cx43) localization and function in cultured mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigate the functional and cellular effects of Tmem65 reductions on the myocardium in a mouse model by injecting CD1 mouse pups (3-7 days after birth) with recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 (rAAV9) harboring Tmem65 shRNA, which reduces Tmem65 expression by 90% in mouse ventricles compared to scrambled shRNA injection. Tmem65 knockdown (KD) results in increased mortality which is accompanied by eccentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy within 3 weeks of injection and progression to dilated cardiomyopathy with severe cardiac fibrosis by 7 weeks post-injection. Tmem65 KD hearts display depressed hemodynamics as measured echocardiographically as well as slowed conduction in optical recording accompanied by prolonged PR intervals and QRS duration in electrocardiograms. Immunoprecipitation and super-resolution microscopy demonstrate a physical interaction between Tmem65 and sodium channel β subunit (β1) in mouse hearts and this interaction appears to be required for both the establishment of perinexal nanodomain structure and the localization of both voltage-gated sodium channel 1.5 (NaV1.5) and Cx43 to ICDs. Despite the loss of NaV1.5 at ICDs, whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology did not reveal reductions in Na<SUP>+</SUP> currents but did show reduced Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> and K<SUP>+</SUP> currents in Tmem65 KD cardiomyocytes in comparison to control cells. We conclude that disrupting Tmem65 function results in impaired ICD structure, abnormal cardiac electrophysiology, and ultimately cardiomyopathy.",

The data processing usually involves the so-called Abel inversion method or the numerical ray-tracing technique. Both these approaches are now well established, however, they do not allow to easily determine the uncertainty profiles in the atmospheric properties, and this makes the results difficult to interpret statistically. Recently, a purely analytical approach based on the time transfer functions formalism was proposed for modeling radio occultation data. Using this formulation, we derive uncertainty relationships between the frequency shift and the thermodynamic properties of the neutral atmosphere such as the temperature, pressure, and neutral number density. These expressions are important for interpreting previous results from past radio occultation experiments. They are especially relevant for deriving the system requirements for future missions in a rigorous manner and consistently with the scientific requirements about the atmospheric properties retrieval.",

Although the detections were of comparable rates for solar minimum and solar maximum (5.4% and 5.0%, respectively), the distribution of the waves was significantly different. During solar minimum the waves were observed most often between 0600 LT and 1200 LT, while in solar maximum the waves were mostly observed near midnight. However, for both periods the peak observation rates occurred at an altitude of 250 km. At this altitude, whistler-mode waves were observed ~8% of the time on average throughout the mission. The median Poynting flux of the signals was 1.4 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>W/m<SUP>2</SUP> and the peak values occurred at low altitudes, implying a lightning source from below the ionosphere.

A multi-spacecraft study of ICME properties between 0.3 and 2.2 au is conducted: we first investigate the global expansion by tracking the variation in magnetic field strength with increasing heliocentric distance of individual ICME events, finding significant variability in magnetic field relationships for individual events in comparison with statistical trends. With the availability of plasma data at 1 au, the local expansion at 1 au can be compared with global expansion rates between 1 au and Juno. Despite following expected trends, the local and global expansion rates are only weakly correlated. Finally, for those events with clearly identifiable magnetic flux ropes, we investigate the orientation of the flux rope axis as they propagate; we find that 64% of events displayed a decrease in inclination with increasing heliocentric distance, and 40% of events undergo a significant change in orientation as they propagate toward Juno. The multi-spacecraft catalog produced in this study provides a valuable link between ICME observations in the inner heliosphere and beyond 1 au, thereby improving our understanding of ICME evolution.",

The PSA occurrences over both a Carrington rotation (CR) and a year can be well fitted by a Gaussian distribution. However, large-scale magnetic structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), can significantly deviate the PSA distribution of a CR from the Gaussian distribution. The PSA distributions of each CR and each year are affected by the solar activity: They are more concentrated at a relatively higher average PSA at solar maximum. There is also a weak anticorrelation between the yearly solar wind speed (v <SUB>sw</SUB>) and the average PSA. MESSENGER, Venus Express, and ACE observations at different heliocentric distances within 1 au show that the dominating polarities of the heliospheric magnetic field change greatly from year to year even when the solar activity is on the same level. Our results suggest that the PSA distribution in addition to the sunspot number can provide some new information on the magnetic field variation of the Sun.",

Around 2011 March 22, the Venus EXpress (VEX) and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-A (STEREO-A) were nearly at the same longitude, providing us with an excellent opportunity to study the formation and evolution of the complex structures. The shock and ICMELS investigated in this paper are isolated near Venus, but when they approach STEREO-A, the shock nearly approaches the front edge of the ICMELS and forms a shock-ICMELS complex structure. The maximal magnetic field in the ICMELS increased 2.3 times due to shock compression, according to the observation. The recovery model, which restores the shocked portion of the shock-ICMELS to its uncompressed condition, likewise confirms this improvement. The interaction with the ICMELS, on the other hand, weakens shock 2. The magnetic compression ratio falls from 2.4 at Venus to 2.0 at STEREO-A.

From comparison to the wind velocity derived from tracking of the descent probes, these measurements correspond to 60 ± 3 km altitude, being between two levels 70 ± 2 km and 55 ± 2 km, probed by VMC in ultraviolet (UV) (365 nm) and NIR (965 nm) channels, respectively. The mean zonal wind suggests retrograde circulation with mean zonal wind speed decreasing from 76.5 to 61.5 m/s at 30°-65°S. In low latitudes, 10-20°S, it increased to 82 m/s over the course of the mission. The mean zonal flow depends on local solar time and latitude and is affected by the large-scale topography. The meridional winds indicated equatorward flow of up to 7 m/s in the middle and low cloud opposite to that derived from simultaneous UV observations at the cloud top.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that the peritumoral area may possess an epileptic focus and that biological alterations in the peritumoral area may cause epileptic symptoms in patients with glioma. To test our hypothesis, we developed a rat model of glioma and characterized it at the cellular and molecular levels. We first labeled rat C6 glioma cells with tdTomato, a red fluorescent protein (C6-tdTomato), and implanted them into the somatosensory cortex of VGAT-Venus rats, which specifically expressed Venus, a yellow fluorescent protein in GABAergic neurons. We observed that the density of GABAergic neurons was significantly decreased in the peritumoral area of rats with glioma compared with the contralateral healthy side. By using a combination technique of laser capture microdissection and RNA sequencing (LCM-seq) of paraformaldehyde-fixed brain sections, we demonstrated that 19 genes were differentially expressed in the peritumoral area and that five of them were associated with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, the canonical pathways actively altered in the peritumoral area were predicted to cause a reduction in GABAergic neurons. These results suggest that biological alterations in the peritumoral area may be a cause of glioma-related epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "We present the first statistical analysis of complexity changes affecting the magnetic structure of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), with the aim of answering the questions: How frequently do ICMEs undergo magnetic complexity changes during propagation? What are the causes of such changes? Do the in situ properties of ICMEs differ depending on whether they exhibit complexity changes? We consider multispacecraft observations of 31 ICMEs by MESSENGER, Venus Express, ACE, and STEREO between 2008 and 2014 while radially aligned. By analyzing their magnetic properties at the inner and outer spacecraft, we identify complexity changes that manifest as fundamental alterations or significant reorientations of the ICME. Plasma and suprathermal electron data at 1 au, and simulations of the solar wind enable us to reconstruct the propagation scenario for each event, and to identify critical factors controlling their evolution. Results show that ~65% of ICMEs change their complexity between Mercury and 1 au and that interaction with multiple large-scale solar wind structures is the driver of these changes. Furthermore, 71% of ICMEs observed at large radial (&gt;0.4 au) but small longitudinal (&lt;15°) separations exhibit complexity changes, indicating that propagation over large distances strongly affects ICMEs. Results also suggest that ICMEs may be magnetically coherent over angular scales of at least 15°, supporting earlier theoretical and observational estimates. This work presents statistical evidence that magnetic complexity changes are consequences of ICME interactions with large-scale solar wind structures, rather than intrinsic to ICME evolution, and that such changes are only partly identifiable from in situ measurements at 1 au.",

      "abstract": "Accurate measurements of ambient planetary and interplanetary magnetic fields using spacecraft magnetometers typically require accounting for interfering magnetic fields generated by the flight system (FS). The most common method for removing FS-generated time-variable magnetic fields is narrow-band and low-pass filtering of magnetic field data in the frequency domain. However, if fluctuations in the ambient field contain frequencies overlapping those in the FS field, it can be difficult to construct a filter that will not affect both signals. Here we present an alternate method for removing FS time-variable signatures from magnetic field measurements. For spacecraft that make use of a magnetic gradiometer (i.e. with two or more instruments on a boom at different distances from the center of the spacecraft), the dominant frequencies in the FS field can be identified using spectra of the differenced field components. The amplitudes of the FS field at those frequencies can then be suppressed without removing spectral peaks present in the ambient field. We demonstrate the successful application of this method, referred to as gradiometry peak suppression, both to modeled data sets and to 128 Hz Venus Express magnetometer data.",

Pioneer Venus Orbiter could not establish how much farther into the wake of Venus tail rays extend, nor understand how they form. Here we present plasma and fields data from the fourth flyby of Venus by NASA's Parker Solar Probe consistent with an intercept with an ionospheric tail ray. The observations unambiguously demonstrate that Venusian Ionotail Rays can extend to at least 7,800 km in altitude. Using the new Parker observations we are able to identify a tail ray encounter within the Venus Express dataset. We thus present a unified picture of the structure of the magnetotail of Venus based on combined Venus Express, Pioneer Venus Orbiter, and Parker observations, and recent hybrid modeling.",

Localized disturbances were detected by applying a wavelet transform to the temperature profiles. The packet lengths were found to be distributed over 0.6-10 km, in which typically 1.5-4.0 oscillations are included. The number of oscillations per wave packet was found to have only a slight dependence on the wavelength, which is consistent with the -3 power law dependence of the spectral density on the wavenumber in the saturation model. The spectral densities of the wave packets are roughly aligned with the power law of the saturation model, while the saturation ratio for each quasi-monochromatic wave is low. This suggests that the saturated spectrum is produced by the superposition of individually unsaturated quasi-monochromatic waves. Waves with short vertical wavelengths (&lt;1.5 km) were found to be more prevalent at lower altitudes than at higher altitudes, implying an effect of radiative damping during upward propagation. The amplitude was found to be larger at higher latitudes, which might be attributed to an increase in background static stability at high latitudes, which allows larger saturation amplitudes.",

For chronologically collected specimens from patients with ATL or pre-onset individuals, we integrate deep DNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing to detect the somatic mutations and virus directly and characterize the transcriptional readouts in respective subclones. Characteristic genomic and transcriptomic patterns are associated with subclonal expansion and switches during the clinical timeline. Multistep mutations in the T-cell receptor (TCR), STAT3, and NOTCH pathways establish clone-specific transcriptomic abnormalities and further accelerate their proliferative potential to develop highly malignant clones, leading to disease onset and progression.

Here we study the well-structured Venusian IMB with a sudden magnetic field rotation and a sharp magnetosheath plasma decrease using Venus Express observations. We statistically investigate the location of such well-structured IMB and give an average location of the IMB at solar maximum. The solar activity and solar wind controls of the Venusian IMB location is also studied in this work. Our results show that the dayside Venusian IMB distance increases with solar activity, but it decreases with increasing solar wind dynamic pressure and interplanetary magnetic field cone angle. The behaviors of the IMB under these conditions are similar to those of the ionopause, indicating that the distance of the Venusian IMB is much correlated with the scale of the ionosphere. We suggest that the variation of the IMB is partially contributed to by the variation of the ionopause, whose altitude is determined by the pressure balance between ionospheric thermal pressure and external magnetic pressure.",

This feature was found to have a consistent planet-circling period of 4.9 days, and subsequent searches of past imagery revealed that it has probably existed for at least 30 years, the duration of near-infrared investigation of the deep atmosphere of Venus. Guided by the remarkably consistent morphological appearance of this feature, we have identified at least one previous instance of it in the Venus Express Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) data. We take advantage of the spectroscopic capabilities of VIRTIS to retrieve atmospheric parameters in the vicinity of this feature that cannot be retrieved using the limited filter selection on board Akatsuki. We find that the changes in measurable quantities, such as cloud particle acid mass fraction, water vapor, carbon monoxide, cloud base altitude, and particle size, suggest that the changes that take place in the vicinity of this feature are restricted to the lower clouds of Venus (below 50 km). We hypothesize that further evolution of this feature (over timescales of days to weeks) results in measurable variations in these parameters at altitudes in the middle clouds of Venus (50-57 km), lending credence to its identification as a baroclinic trough or Kelvin front.",

About 800 of these could be used for an analysis of the radio signal absorption at X-Band (wavelength: 3.6 cm), which is mainly caused by sulfuric acid vapor within the Venus atmosphere. The absorptivity profiles were converted into sulfuric acid vapor profiles. The combined measurements from the entire Venus Express mission reveal a distinct latitudinal H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) variation. A latitudinal gradient can be observed at the topside of the H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) layer, which is located approx. 4 km higher at equatorial latitudes compared to polar latitudes. Regions of enhanced sulfuric acid vapor abundance were found at equatorial and polar latitudes. The highest H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) values at equatorial latitudes show mean maximal values of more than 12 ppm at around 47 km altitude. At polar latitudes mean maximal values were found at around 43 km altitude and ranged from 9 to 12 ppm. Both latitudinal regions of increased sulfuric acid vapor abundance are clearly separated by a low abundance region located at mid-latitudes with values of 5 to 7 ppm. <P />A simplified two-dimensional transport model was developed to study the formation processes of sulfuric acid vapor accumulation at equatorial and polar latitudes. It turned out that the H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) accumulation observed at high latitudes can be explained by precipitation of H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(l) droplets that evaporate into gaseous sulfuric acid upon entering lower (warmer) altitudes. The influence of wind transport on this formation process was minor. In contrast, the H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) accumulation observed at equatorial latitudes could be reproduced in the model by oppositely directed mass transport (upward winds and sedimentation) as well as by simplified evaporation and condensation processes. The low H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) abundance observed at mid-latitudes was reproduced by downward winds in the model calculations. <P />The VeRa observations were additionally used to estimate the abundance of SO<SUB>2</SUB> above the cloud bottom. A latitudinal dependence was found with highest values of 90 ± 60 ppm at equatorial latitudes, compared to 150 ± 50 ppm and 160 ± 50 ppm at southern and northern polar latitudes, respectively. <P />Both the equatorial and polar regions displayed show large variability of the H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) and SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundances from observation to observation. A weak tidal influence is also visible in the sulfuric acid vapor abundance in the equatorial region. The northern polar H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>(g) abundance, as well as the southern and northern SO<SUB>2</SUB> abundances, exhibit distinct long-term variations.",

The shock angle Θ<SUB>Bn</SUB>, defined as the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field, and the magnetic compression ratio r<SUB>B</SUB>, defined as the ratio of the magnetic field strength downstream to that upstream, of these shocks are determined based on the magnetic coplanarity method. The shock occurrence at Venus shows a correlated variation with the solar activity level measured by the number of sunspots, while the shock angle and magnetic compression ratio do not show such a correspondence. The shock angle spreads almost uniformly between 10° and 80° with its mean value at about 45°, and the magnetic compression ratio shows a unimodal distribution between 1.0 and 4.5 with a mean value of 2.1. In addition, we also analyze the properties of fast forward shocks driven by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We found that interplanetary shocks with and without detected ICMEs showed no significant differences in terms of the shock strength and the shock angle. Further comparison with previous observational results at 1 au shows that fast forward shocks at 1 au are generally weaker than those at 0.72 au, and the shock angle Θ<SUB>Bn</SUB> is more perpendicular at 1 au.",

We used image navigation and processing techniques based on contrast enhancement and geometrical projections to characterise morphological properties of the detected waves, such as horizontal wavelength and the relative optical thickness drop between crests and troughs. Additionally, we performed phase velocity and trajectory tracking of wave packets. We combined these observations to derive other properties of the waves such as the vertical wavelength of detected packets. Our observations include 13 months of data from August 2007 to October 2008, and the entire available data set of IR2 from January to November 2016. We characterised almost 300 wave packets across more than 5500 images over a broad region of the globe of Venus. Our results show a wide range of properties and are not only consistent with previous observations but also expand upon them, taking advantage of two instruments that target the same cloud layer of Venus across multiple periods. In general, waves observed on the nightside lower cloud are of a larger scale than the gravity waves reported in the upper cloud. This paper is intended to provide a more in-depth view of atmospheric gravity waves on the lower cloud and enable follow-up works on their influence in the general circulation of Venus.",

One important water loss process comes from the energy and momentum transfer from the solar wind to the atmospheric particles. Here, we used measurements from the Ion Mass Analyzer onboard Venus Express to derive a relation between the power in the upstream solar wind and the power leaving the atmosphere through oxygen ion escape in the Venusian magnetotail. We find that on average 0.01% of the available power is transferred, and that the percentage decreases as the available energy increases. For Mars the trend is similar, but the efficiency is higher. At Earth, the ion escape does not behave similarly, as the ion escape only increases after a threshold in the available energy is reached. These results indicate that the Venusian induced magnetosphere efficiently screens the atmosphere from the solar wind.",

Here we demonstrate that angiogenesis is started near Aß plaques in both AD mouse models and human AD samples. However, endothelial cells express the molecular signature of non-productive angiogenesis (NPA) and accumulate, around Aß plaques, a tip cell marker and IB4 reactive vascular anomalies with reduced NOTCH activity. Notably, NPA induction by endothelial loss of presenilin, whose mutations cause familial AD and which activity has been shown to decrease with age, produced a similar vascular phenotype in the absence of Aß pathology. We also show that Aß plaque-associated NPA locally disassembles blood vessels, leaving behind vascular scars, and that microglial phagocytosis contributes to the local loss of endothelial cells. These results define the role of NPA and microglia in local blood vessel disassembly and highlight the vascular component of presenilin loss of function in AD.",

Evidence of magnetic reconnection is based on two cases recorded by Venus Express in the Venusian magnetotail. In both cases, the variations of the magnetic field components are consistent with the classical picture of crossing the ion diffusion region. Our evidence is also supported by observed ion flows whose directions and speeds agree with expected characteristics of reconnection outflow.

      "abstract": "Collisionless shocks are one of the most effective particle accelerators in the known universe. Even low Mach number shocks could have a significant role in particle heating and acceleration. Theory suggests that kinematic collisionless relaxation, the process whereby a downstream nongyroptopic ion population becomes thermalized through collisionless gyrophase mixing, is the dominant energy redistribution mechanism in quasi-perpendicular, low Mach number, and low β shocks. However, there have only been a limited number of observations of these shocks using in situ measurements at Venus, Earth and in interplanetary space. This paper presents the results of the first detailed study using in situ measurements, of the effect of fundamental parameters on the formation of these shocks. All low Mach number shocks occurring during the magnetic cloud phase of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection are identified in Venus Express magnetic field data over the duration of the mission. From the 92 shock crossings identified, 38 show clear evidence of kinematic relaxation. It is shown that kinematic relaxation is dominant at Venus when the angle between the local shock normal and upstream magnetic field is greater 50° and the Alfvén Mach number is less than 1.4. These shocks are also observed across a range of solar-zenith-angles indicating that it is likely that any location on the Venus bow shock could form such a structure. Venus Express plasma measurements are used to verify the parameters estimated from the magnetic field and indicate the importance of heavy ions, including potential pickup O<SUP>+</SUP>.",

By promoting mesodermal identity through manipulation of WNT signalling while preventing exit from pluripotency using lysophosphatidic acid, we `trap' and maintain cells in a lineage-biased stem cell state through multiple passages. These cells correspond to a normal state on the differentiation trajectory, the plasticity of which is evidenced by their reacquisition of an unbiased state upon removal of differentiation cues.

Our results show that the magnetic barrier becomes weak and narrow, and the ionosphere can be demagnetized under the IMF with the dominating flow-aligned component while the solar wind dynamic pressure remains almost unchanged. The demagnetization of the Venusian ionosphere implies that the total pressure of the magnetic barrier above the ionopause decreases. The magnetic field lines upstream from Venus drape differently under the nearly flow-aligned IMF condition. And thus the upstream solar wind flow is affected by the outward magnetic tension, which leads to the decrease of the dynamic pressure that directly acts on the magnetic barrier.",

The invasive North American channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque, 1818) is such a case, having been shown to not only have considerable impacts to native biodiversity, but also to expand its range. Several decades ago, I. punctatus was introduced to Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. This study investigates the seasonal dynamics of I. punctatus' trophic niche over three consecutive years. Stable isotopes analyses of carbon (δ<SUP>13</SUP>C) and nitrogen (δ<SUP>15</SUP>N) were utilized to assess isotopic niche variation and feeding habitat. Results demonstrate ontogenetic variations in I. punctatus' trophic position and feeding habitat, influenced by both season and year. Ictalurus punctatus exhibited a wider isotopic niche and greater interindividual dispersion during spring and summer compared to autumn and winter. While the occupied isotopic niche space remained stable across years, significant seasonal differences were observed in 2 out of 3 years. These seasonal differences underscore the high trophic plasticity of I. punctatus, facilitating its ability to exploit a diverse spectrum of resources.

      "abstract": "Farmlands are becoming more important as waterfowl foraging habitats, while natural wetlands are being lost globally. However, it is unclear how waterfowl coexist in agricultural landscapes by resource partitioning. We evaluated the diets of seven sympatric dabbling ducks foraging in rice paddy and lotus fields around Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, during two wintering seasons (from November to February) by faecal DNA metabarcoding using chloroplast trnL and mitochondrial CO1 region sequences. We examined 420 faecal samples and found different patterns of dietary diversity and composition among the duck species. The pattern also differed between plant and invertebrate food. Dietary niche partitioning was clear in plant food. Large-bodied ducks intensively use crop plants, and other ducks might mediate competition by using terrestrial and aquatic plants that are suitable for their foraging behaviours or microhabitats. Dietary segregation among species was the most apparent in February, when the abundance of foraging ducks was the largest. This study illustrated the complex pattern of dietary niche partitioning of dabbling ducks in agricultural landscapes, which might be difficult to evaluate by conventional approaches. The availability of crop plants, as well as other plant food resources in flooted areas and farmland dikes, may enable ducks to coexist by spatial or behavioural resource partitioning.",

      "abstract": "Inland and coastal waters provide key ecosystem services and are closely linked to human well-being. In this study, we propose a semi-analytical method, which can be applied to Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images to retrieve high spatial-resolution total suspended solids (TSS) concentration in a broad spectrum of aquatic ecosystems ranging from clear to extremely turbid waters. The presented approach has four main steps. First, the remote sensing reflectance (R<SUB>rs</SUB>) at a band lacking in MSI (620 nm) is estimated through an empirical relationship from R<SUB>rs</SUB> at 665 nm. Second, waters are classified into four types (clear, moderately turbid, highly turbid, and extremely turbid). Third, semi-analytical algorithms are used to estimate the particulate backscattering coefficient (b<SUB>bp</SUB>) at a reference band depending on the water types. Last, TSS is estimated from b<SUB>bp</SUB> at the reference band. Validation and comparison of the proposed method with three existing methods are performed using a simulated dataset (N = 1000), an in situ dataset collected from global inland and coastal waters (N = 1265) and satellite matchups (N = 40). Results indicate that the proposed method can improve TSS estimation and provide accurate retrievals of TSS from all three datasets, with a median absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.88 %, 31.50 % and 41.69 % respectively. We also present comparisons of TSS mapping between the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and MSI in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan and the Tagus Estuary, Portugal. Results clearly demonstrate the advantages of using MSI for TSS monitoring in small water bodies such as rivers, river mouths and other nearshore waters. MSI can provide more detailed and realistic TSS estimates than OLCI in these water bodies. The proposed TSS estimation method was applied to MSI images to produce TSS time-series in Lake Kasumigaura, which showed good agreements with in situ and OLCI-derived TSS time-series.",

      "abstract": "To assess the population dynamics, abundance of bitterling species and two non-bitterling cyprinid species were investigated in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. Fish capture was conducted at nine sites, including rivers or agricultural ditches independently flowing into the lake, every September from 2005 to 2013. Large fluctuations in the abundance of four bitterling species were observed during survey years. Regional population decline of Acheilognathus tabira erythropterus and Acheilognathus melanogaster was detected through 9 years of survey. In addition, spatial synchrony between bitterling species was also observed in the population dynamics. On the other hand, no significant synchrony was observed between bitterlings and the two non-bitterling species. Synchrony of native bitterlings declined with increasing distance, whereas that of Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus was almost constant regardless of distance. These results supported that the spatially synchronous decline of bitterling species was caused by the Moran effect and dispersal. In other words, results of this study showed that factors that vary over a regional scale, such as climate, and the loss of connectivity among habitats may have contributed to the decline of bitterling species.",

However, mixing processes in shallow lakes are not well understood because of the lack of turbulence measurements. This study presents observations of vertical mixing and oxygen flux in a shallow lake, Lake Kitaura of the Lake Kasumigaura continuous lake system, which is located along the central eastern coast of the Japanese mainland. Mooring and microstructure surveys were conducted in August 2020. The vertical eddy diffusivity was estimated from the Ellison scale using high-frequency sampled temperature data from the mooring location, and the estimations were consistent with those observed from the microstructure profiler. The estimated eddy diffusivity revealed a mixing structure and oxygen flux in the lake during the study period. The daily cycle of stratification and mixing was caused by daily heating due to solar radiation and by winds from daily sea breezes, respectively. The daily stratification maximum occurred around noon, which suppressed vertical mixing. Vertical mixing was intensified due to sea breezes in the afternoon, which led to movement of oxygen from the surface layer to the bottom layer. The maximum vertical mixing was observed at 18:00. The oxygen concentration did not increase during nighttime when the negative surface heat flux was observed; thus, nighttime cooling may not primarily contribute to the vertical oxygen supply.",

      "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of future water levels holds significance for water resources management and flood early warning. Although there have been some studies on applying the hydrological data-driven model to predict the water level and discharge of rivers and reservoirs, there are few studies on its application to shallow lakes controlled by the gate. Taking Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, as the study area, this study aims to construct a data-driven model for the lake water level prediction and to evaluate its performance. The observed hourly data of precipitation, air temperature and wind speed within the lake basin, as well as the water level at the Itako hydrometric station from April to November 2019 were collected. The first 80% of the data was selected as the training set, followed by calculating the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to select the input variables for the model. Five machine learning techniques including support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), back propagation neural network (BPNN), random forests (RF) and M5 model trees (M5P) were adopted to train the model respectively. The model's performance on predicting water levels at 1-hour, 6-hour, 12-hour and 24-hour lead times under different machine learning algorithms was lastly quantitatively evaluated by Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), hit rate (HR) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results indicate that the model trained by the M5P algorithm delivers better performance in general, but the accuracy of all algorithms in predicting water levels for periods of heavy rains and typhoons could be further improved. Water level prediction results based on the data-driven approach will benefit the water resources management and decision-making for local authorities. Hybridisation with process-based modelling could be tried in the future to further assess its ability in forecasting water levels at longer lead times.",

Further measurements of radiocesium concentrations in suspended solids (SS) have been conducted since September 2012 in the Koise and Sakura rivers inflowing into the lake. Cesium-137 (<SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs) accumulated intensively near the inflow outlets in the lake. At the lake center, the <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs inventory in sediments increased during 2011–2014; however, few changes were observed during 2014–2016. The <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs surface concentration and inventory decreased considerably in Tsuchiura-iri Bay until 3 years after the accident, indicating <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs migration. However, the rate of decrease subsequently slowed due to the <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs supply from the river. The <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs concentration in river SS declined during 2012–2015; however, it remained 1–2 orders of magnitude above its pre-accident level. The entrainment coefficient of particulate <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs in the inflows was initially higher in the Koise River but decreased exponentially more rapidly in the Koise River than in the Sakura River until 2015. Therefore, in the future, the difference in <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs concentrations will be smaller. The <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs concentration in the Koise River will continue to decrease; thus, the difference in the <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs inventory between the northern and southern parts of the lake will decrease. Total estimated amounts of <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs in the entire lake were 3.72 × 10<SUP loc=\"post\">12</SUP> Bq in December 2012 and 4.18 × 10<SUP loc=\"post\">12</SUP> Bq in August 2016. The accumulated amount of <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs in the entire lake based on sediment analysis was similar to the riverine input of particulate <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs based on riverine SS analysis from December 2012‒;August 2016, confirming the high trapping performance of the lake for particulate matter provided by the basin. Moreover, the amount of <SUP loc=\"post\">137</SUP>Cs accumulated in the lake in 2016 may have originated from comparable rates of atmospheric deposition and riverine input. These findings provide useful insights for future prediction and management of radiocesium contamination and the effects of riverine inputs in general shallow lakes.",

In this study, we made four efforts to improve a state-of-the-art ZSD estimation algorithm that was developed in 2019 on the basis of a new underwater visibility theory proposed in 2015. The four efforts were: (1) classifying all water into clear (Type I), moderately turbid (Type II), highly turbid (Type III), or extremely turbid (Type IV) water types; (2) selecting different reference wavelengths and corresponding semianalytical models for each water type; (3) employing an estimation model to represent reasonable shapes for particulate backscattering coefficients based on the water type classification; and (4) constraining likely wavelength range at which the minimum diffuse attenuation coefficient (K<SUB>d</SUB>(λ)) will occur for each water type. The performance of the proposed ZSD estimation algorithm was compared to that of the original state-of-the-art algorithm using a simulated dataset (N = 91,287, ZSD values 0.01 to 44.68 m) and an in situ measured dataset (N = 305, ZSD values 0.3 to 16.4 m). The results showed a significant improvement with a reduced mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) from 116% to 65% for simulated data and from 32% to 27% for in situ data. Outliers in the previous algorithm were well addressed in the new algorithm. We further evaluated the developed ZSD estimation algorithm using medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) images acquired from Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. The results obtained from 19 matchups revealed that the estimated ZSD matched well with the in situ measured ZSD, with a MAPE of 15%. The developed ZSD estimation algorithm can probably be applied to different optical water types due to its semianalytical features.",

Although the spatial variability of CNRs has been extensively explored, temporal variations of CNRs at the individual lake scale has rarely been discussed. The paucity of information about temporal dependence in CNRs may in part be due to the lack of a suitable statistical framework that helps guide such investigations. In order to reveal temporal dependence of CNR, this study develop a novel statistical framework. In the framework, we employ quantile regression to generate overall (the entire dataset), annual (subsets for each year), and accumulative (subsets collected before a certain year) CNRs. We aim to 1) show biases of annual relationships by comparing the overall and annual relationships and 2) determine whether or not data accumulation is enough to develop a reliable CNR. We use Lake Champlain and Lake Kasumigaura as case studies to illustrate the necessary steps needed to utilize this novel framework. Results show that large interannual variations exist for CNRs. Accumulative relationships tend to converge to the overall relationship, indicating that overall relationships are reliable for informing lake-specific eutrophication management in the two case study lakes. The novel statistical framework that we propose for a procedure to estimate reliable CNRs is important for informing lake-specific eutrophication control decision-making processes.",

      "abstract": "Understanding pollution of inland waters is critical, particularly regarding water security for human life and the impact of pollution at the ocean. However, due to the frequency and number of observation points, the in-situ measurement method is insufficient. The current trend of using remote sensing tools is heavily reliant on the angle of incidence of sunlight and the intensity of waves on the water surface. Only a handful of studies in isolating and quantitatively estimating pollution due to multiple factors, especially in field measurement, have been developed. A spectral reflectance with polarization at visible and near-infrared wavelengths is obtained to address these issues. Satellite data, water sampling, and spectro-polarimetric measurement using small vessels are carried out in Lake Kasumigaura at four stations (Kakemaoki station, centre of the lake, Koshin station, and marina). SpectrumCatcher is mounted on a tripod and configured to measure at the wavelength ranging from 500 nm to 800 nm and the elevation angle is at 50 from nadir with a polarization angles of 0, 45, and 90. The images are taken five times with a fixed exposure of 256 ms. The sky radiances were also measured. The water sample is tested at AIST using a Hach Model 2100P ISO Portable Turbidimeter. In addition, remote sensing data from Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 (A/B) MSI, and PlanetScope 4-band in October and November 2020 was obtained for validation. At first, the reflected skylight is removed from the total reflectance resulting in a 50% reduction of reflectance in the measurement. Thus, the spectral features of Lake Kasumigauras water have been found to correspond to CDOM rich water but previous study stated that Lake Kasumigaura has a low CDOM concentration. Station 1 recorded a higher Chlorophyll concentration estimation than the other stations, while Station 4 recorded a high Soil concentration estimation through the field measurement. Satellite data and water sample result show otherwise. There is a discrepancy in the result between all three methods, and it may be due to errors in the measurement such as different dates, environment conditions, and so forth. Nevertheless, the field measurement with polarization shows a small capability in quick and accurate water contaminant concentration determination in natural conditions.",

      "abstract": "Accurate and timely monitoring of phytoplankton gross primary production (GPP) at a regional to global scale using satellite measurements plays an important role in understanding the global carbon cycle, but has long been hampered by the lack of an effective approach to remotely retrieve two crucial photosynthetic parameters, i.e., assimilation number (PBmax) and light saturation parameter (Ek) involved in the GPP modeling for various aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we proposed a novel machine-learning algorithm with an improved extrapolation capability, the Enhanced Random Forest Regression (ERFR), to retrieve PBmax and Ek from four environmental parameters that can be routinely estimated from remote sensing measurements, i.e., water temperature (T), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla), vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) (Kd(PAR)), and light transmittance of downwelling PAR (rPAR). The ERFR was developed and evaluated using extensive in situ datasets from oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. The retrievals of PBmax and Ek were supplied into an analytical primary production model, the Theoretical Production Model (TPM), to testify its performance on the GPP modeling. The performance assessments with in situ data suggested that the ERFR worked well for estimating PBmax and Ek in clear to turbid waters and thus contributed to satisfactory GPP estimates based on the TPM. As evidenced through remote sensing evaluations, the ERFR outperformed two earlier proposed algorithms and the ERFR-based modeling provided a significant improvement in GPP estimates with the root mean square difference (RMSD) and the unbiased absolute percentage difference (UAPD) reducing by ~0.070.22 and ~22.546.1%, respectively. The preliminary applications of the ERFR and TPM for the global ocean, the upper Chesapeake Bay, USA, and Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, further corroborated their potential utility of generating seamless GPP products in global aquatic ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "The dry and wet depositions of atmospheric ammonia (NH<SUB>3</SUB>) is one of the important pathways of nitrogen loads to aquatic ecosystems and should be managed to mitigate lake eutrophication. Crop and livestock agriculture, one of the largest emitters of NH<SUB>3</SUB> in Asian countries, are known to cause high spatial and seasonal variation of NH<SUB>3</SUB> and influence the surrounding lake basin areas via its dry and wet deposition. However, the spatial characteristics of the NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentration in basin scale are not completely understood for regulation in NH<SUB>3</SUB> emission because a paucity of monitoring network is currently available for NH<SUB>3</SUB> in many Asian countries. Here we aim to clarify dominant factors of spatial and seasonal variations of the NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentration in a shallow eutrophic lake basin (Lake Kasumigaura basin) surrounded by agricultural areas in eastern Japan. Passive sampling over various land use categories in the basin was conducted at 36 sites in total from October 10, 2018 to January 14, 2020. Mean NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentration in the observational period was in the order of farmland (6.6 ppbv), lake (5.9 ppbv), rural (3.5 ppbv), and forest (2.6 ppbv). Interestingly, the observed NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentration near the livestock houses were higher in winter than summer, which was inconsistent with knowledge of seasonal changes of current NH<SUB>3</SUB> emission inventory based on temperature-driven volatilization process. Comparing monthly NH<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations at farmland and lake sites with various meteorological factors, we suggested the importance of seasonal advection of NH<SUB>3</SUB> from high emission sources to which has been rarely paid attention by the previous past studies. Consequently, a higher nitrogen input by dry deposition of NH<SUB>3</SUB> was preliminarily estimated over the lake than that of wet deposition of total nitrogen. Our finding of a role of seasonal advection in NH<SUB>3</SUB> spatial pattens should be considered for lake ecosystem management since its deposition is known to be closely related to the ecological processes such as phytoplankton blooming.",

We created EB maps of Lake Kasumigaura, a 172-km<SUP>2</SUP> shallow lake in Japan, with a 90-m horizontal resolution at a 3-hr interval over 5 years based on spatially interpolated meteorological variables and water surface temperature, with turbulent fluxes estimated by the bulk equations. The results indicate that turbulent fluxes and total energy flux into water body G were spatially variable while radiative fluxes were more uniform. The spatial variability of turbulent fluxes averaged over a season, a year, and 5 years was mainly caused by wind speed difference; a longer fetch in downwind areas of the lake resulted in strong winds and higher turbulent fluxes. The spatial difference of turbulent fluxes and quasi-uniform net radiation caused a total energy flux out of the water in the downwind area and a total energy flux into the lake in an upwind area. This spatial difference of G appeared to be compensated by heat transport from the upwind to downwind area through advection due to lake current.",

      "abstract": "Physical processes associated with hypoxia events in a shallow lake, Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, are investigated with long-term mooring observations at the middle of the lake basin. Results show that strong stratification during the summer suppresses vertical mixing resulting in hypoxia in the bottom boundary layer. The dissolved oxygen decreases due to the limited oxygen supply under strongly stratified conditions. The intensity of the stratification is controlled by the ratio between surface wind stress and the surface incoming buoyancy flux. The Monin–Obukhov length scale explains the stratification and shows good agreement with the Froude number and Wedderburn number. The stratification is also enhanced by the heat flux towards the sediments, reaching O (100) W m<SUP>‑2</SUP>, during the summer season. In addition to field observations, this study conducted numerical simulations to further investigate mixing structure. Results from numerical simulations indicate that the bottom sediment heat flux significantly contributes to mixing and stratification in the lake. This study suggests that mixing processes associated with winds and heat flux at surface and bottom sediments are the key to understanding hypoxia events in Lake Kasumigaura.",

Results indicated that DO decline (hereafter, &lt;2 mg/L) was negligible at stations with a depth of &lt;5 m. Thus, we consider this depth to be critical depth for studying DO decline conditions in these lakes. The collected data revealed that DO decline events lasting more than 2 days occurred a few times a year. During these events, wind blew weakly (usually, &lt;2 m/s), and diurnal stratification was formed by solar radiation. The averaged DO declining rate leading up to these events was 4.3 (±2.7) mg L<SUP>‑1</SUP> d<SUP>‑1</SUP>, suggesting that within a few days, DO can fall into a declined state. The occurrence probability of DO declined events in the respective summer increased significantly with the proportion of weak wind hours (&lt;2 m/s). Significant correlations between wind velocity and DO change rate (1 hr difference in DO) supported the importance of wind on DO changes in polymictic lakes. The influence of mean air temperature on DO decline events was insignificant.",

Since they have the characteristics of low cost and low power consumption and have no onboard calibrator such as a blackbody or shutter, in-flight calibration should be performed by vicarious calibration (VC) and cross-calibration (CC). In this study, we determined the recalibration coefficients for both of the CIRC instruments as a function of time based on VC experiments in Lake Kasumigaura (Japan) and Railroad Valley Playa (USA), VC with telemetry data from three lakes in Japan and the USA, and CC with imagers onboard two geostationary satellites (MTSAT-2 and Himawari-8). As a result, the derived recalibration coefficients improved the accuracy of the ground-testing-based radiance remarkably in both of the CIRC instruments, suggesting that the recalibrated radiance can satisfy the target accuracy of CIRC, given as 2 K at 300 K. These coefficients, as a function of time, will be applied to all CIRC images by reprocessing planned in the near future.",

During the studied period, BP fluctuated from 1.9 to 138 μg C L<SUP>-1</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>. There were no significant correlations between BP and bacterial abundance in any season, suggesting a strong top-down regulation on BP throughout the year. On the other hand, BP was also related to bottom-up regulation factors such as water temperature, phosphorus, and primary production (PP) annually. During winter, BP was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting that autochthonous substrates were relatively important for BP. Moreover, BP was positively correlated with heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, and copepods, suggesting higher availability of substrates for BP. In summer, although there was no significant correlation between BP and PP, rainfall amount showed significant negative correlations with both BP and PP, suggesting depressed PP from relatively lower solar irradiance coupled with unfavorable weather conditions that decreased the substrate supply for bacteria. These results suggest that temporal variation of BP was regulated not by allochthonous, but by autochthonous substrates during both the highest (summer) and lowest (winter) productive seasons, even in a shallow, eutrophic lake. PP in autumn was approximately half that of spring due to lower solar irradiance, although water temperatures during both seasons were similar and nutrient concentrations during autumn were higher. On the other hand, BP in autumn was comparable with that in spring, and the bacterial carbon demand (= BP + bacterial respiration; 1.12 ± 0.79 g C m<SUP>-2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>) was comparable to PP (1.16 ± 0.53 g C m<SUP>-2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>), suggesting the relative importance of higher allochthonous substrates relative to other seasons.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture faces the great challenge of developing strategies to maintain production while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts. The trade-off between crop production and water quality services is one of the most serious issues facing agriculture, and interest in achieving win–win outcomes through management of ecosystem services is growing. Although wetlands can reduce nitrogen loads, it is unclear whether maintaining and restoring wetlands can ameliorate the trade-off between crop production and water quality and thereby increase the likelihood of win–win outcomes. We defined the orthogonal residuals from the regression line relating the trade-offs between two conflicting services as the degree to which the trade-off was mitigated (mitigation effectiveness score). The more positive the residual, the higher mitigation effectiveness score, and the greater the potential to mitigate the trade-off. We measured nitrate concentrations, as an indicator of water quality, five times during summer and winter across 49 sub-watersheds of the watershed of Lake Kasumigaura, which is highly nitrogen-loaded by agriculture. We quantified the mitigation effectiveness score from the trade-off relationships between cropland area and nitrate concentrations, and we also identified landscape and environmental factors that affected these scores. Some sub-watersheds in our study had high cropland cover but low nitrate concentrations. Overall, we found that mitigation effectiveness scores were positively associated with wetland cover at all sampling times. Other factors, including covers of paddy rice fields, abandoned rice fields, and impervious surfaces, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, had no significant effects on mitigation effectiveness scores, although these factors were considered to increase nitrogen removal. Our findings suggest that maintaining and restoring wetlands might mitigate the trade-off between crop production and water quality and thereby enhance the likelihood of win–win outcomes in agricultural landscapes. Because wetland area has decreased, flooding or ponding abandoned rice fields may be an important alternative management option. The nitrate concentrations we observed met the water quality standard for drinking water, but the fact that they sometimes exceeded the nitrogen environmental target adopted within Lake Kasumigaura in terms of eutrophication suggests that simultaneous reduction of croplands and fertilizer inputs should still be encouraged.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is a central topic in ecology. Multi-trait–based functional diversity has been proposed to improve mechanistic understanding of the BEF relationship; however, how trait-based functional diversity affects ecosystem functioning and processes has rarely been addressed in aquatic ecosystems. Here, we examined the causal relationships between three phytoplankton functional diversity indices (FAD2, functional diversity based on dendrograms [FDc], FRic) and Shannon diversity index versus resource use efficiency for nitrogen (RUE<SUB>N</SUB>), phosphorus (RUE<SUB>P</SUB>) and silicate (RUE<SUB>Si</SUB>), with monthly long-term datasets from the marine (Western English Channel, 2000–2014) and freshwater (Lake Kasumigaura, 1984–2012) ecosystems. We employed Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM), a novel method developed for identifying causality for nonlinear dynamical systems; this is in contrast to linear approaches that cannot distinguish causality from correlation. CCM found that FDc is the most robust functional diversity index among the selected functional diversity indices (FAD2, FDc, FRic) in predicting phytoplankton resource use efficiency and exhibited a much stronger causal effect than the Shannon index. Furthermore, scenario exploration analysis indicates that most causal effects from phytoplankton diversity indices on resource use efficiency (RUE<SUB>N</SUB>, RUE<SUB>P</SUB> and RUE<SUB>Si</SUB>) are on average positive, and FDc exhibited the most consistent positive causal effects on phytoplankton resource efficiency in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. Thus, increasing FDc can enhance phytoplankton resource use efficiency in aquatic ecosystems. Synthesis. Our results show significant causal effects of functional diversity on phytoplankton resource use efficiency in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. Among all selected functional diversity indices, functional diversity based on dendrogram is the most robust functional diversity index in promoting phytoplankton resource efficiency. Our study provides empirical evidences in natural aquatic systems that trait-based functional diversity represents better species niche partitioning than the Shannon index and thereafter enhances resource use efficiency. This finding can improve our understanding on trophic transfer and nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "The Secchi disk depth (Z<SUB>SD</SUB>) is a widely used parameter for evaluating water clarity. Here we propose an improved algorithm, which is based on a new underwater visibility theory, for retrieving more accurate Z<SUB>SD</SUB> from remote sensing reflectance (R<SUB>rs</SUB>) in various waters. Two improvements were carried out in the new algorithm. First, we used a hybrid quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA_hybrid) instead of the sixth version of QAA (QAA_v6) for retrieving more accurate total absorption coefficient (a(λ)) and total backscattering coefficient (b<SUB>b</SUB>(λ)) even in turbid inland waters. Second, we used a dynamic K<SUB>T</SUB> /K<SUB>d</SUB> ratio (i.e., ratio of diffuse attenuation coefficient of upwelling radiance and diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance) instead of using the fixed ratio (i.e., 1.5). The results obtained from in situ R<SUB>rs</SUB> show that the improved Z<SUB>SD</SUB> estimation algorithm gave more accurate Z<SUB>SD</SUB> estimations, with the root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 in log10 unit, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reduced from 39% to 20% (N = 178 with in situ Z<SUB>SD</SUB> values between 0.3 and 20.8 m). We then applied the improved Z<SUB>SD</SUB> estimation algorithm to the 2003-2012 MERIS images for Lake Kasumigaura to further confirm the performance of the improved Z<SUB>SD</SUB> estimation algorithm. The results obtained from 19 matchups demonstrate that the estimated Z<SUB>SD</SUB> matched well with the in situ Z<SUB>SD</SUB>, with the RMSE of 0.11 m and the MAPE of 15%. The improved Z<SUB>SD</SUB> estimation algorithm shows a potential to estimate more accurate Z<SUB>SD</SUB> values from remote sensing data in various waters.",

Since antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) can transfer to pathogenic bacteria in the circulation of human-animal-ecosystems, they are regarded as emerging contaminants. However, little is known about the prevalence of ARGs in water environment. In our study, we investigated the occurrence of ARGs in two watersheds in Japan. Water samples were collected in Tama River in Tokyo in October 2018. Another sampling was conducted in Lake Kasumigaura in Ibaraki Prefecture in November 2018. Four ARGs (bla <SUB>TEM</SUB> encoding extended spectrum β-lactamase, sulI encoding the resistance to sulphonamide, tetA encoding the resistance to tetracycline, ere(A) encoding the resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin) and one mobile genetic element (intI1 encoding integron) were determined by quantitative PCR. In Tama River, bla <SUB>TEM</SUB> and ere(A) were below quantification limit at the most upstream point before receiving wastewater effluent. However, they jumped up in the order of 10<SUP>6</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> copies/L just after receiving the effluent from wastewater treatment plants. The concentrations of the other ARGs and intI1 also increased due to the impact of wastewater effluent. In Lake Kasumigaura, the sampling point which was close to the discharge point of wastewater effluent and the mouth of Sakura River showed the highest copy numbers of intI1, sul1, and ere(A). All target genes were detected at the farthest point in the lake, suggesting that ARGs were persistent in water environment. In order to maintain sustainable water environment, monitoring of ARGs released from wastewater treatment plant is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Nutrient supply is a key bottom-up control of phytoplankton primary production in lake ecosystems. Top-down control via grazing pressure by zooplankton also constrains primary production and primary production may simultaneously affect zooplankton. Few studies have addressed these bidirectional interactions. We used convergent cross-mapping (CCM), a numerical test of causal associations, to quantify the presence and direction of the causal relationships among environmental variables (light availability, surface water temperature, NO<SUB>3</SUB>-N, and PO<SUB>4</SUB>-P), phytoplankton community composition, primary production, and the abundances of five functional zooplankton groups (large cladocerans, small cladocerans, rotifers, calanoids, and cyclopoids) in Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow, hypereutrophic lake in Japan. CCM suggested that primary production was causally influenced by NO<SUB>3</SUB>-N and phytoplankton community composition; there was no detectable evidence of a causal effect of zooplankton on primary production. Our results also suggest that rotifers and cyclopoids were forced by primary production, and cyclopoids were further influenced by rotifers. However, our CCM suggested that primary production was weakly influenced by rotifers (i.e., bidirectional interaction). These findings may suggest complex linkages between nutrients, primary production, and rotifers and cyclopoids, a pattern that has not been previously detected or has been neglected. We used linear regression analysis to examine the relationships between the zooplankton community and pond smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis), the most abundant planktivore and the most important commercial fish species in Lake Kasumigaura. The relative abundance of pond smelt was significantly and positively correlated with the abundances of rotifers and cyclopoids, which were causally influenced by primary production. This finding suggests that bottom-up linkages between nutrient, primary production, and zooplankton abundance might be a key mechanism supporting high planktivore abundance in eutrophic lakes. Because increases in primary production and cyanobacteria blooms are likely to occur simultaneously in hypereutrophic lakes, our study highlights the need for ecosystem management to resolve the conflict between good water quality and high fishery production.",

Sex-reversed XY females have been found in a naturally breeding population established in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. These females could mate with normal XY males and generate YY \"supermale\" individuals that, if viable and fertile, would sire only genotypic male offspring. This study was conducted to verify the viability, gender, and fertility of YY pejerrey and to develop a molecular method for their identification. Production of YY fish was attempted by crossing a thermally sex-reversed XY female and an XY male, and rearing the progeny until sexual maturation. To identify the presumable YY individuals, we first conducted a PCR analysis using amhy-specific primers to screen only amhy-positive (XY and YY) fish. This screening showed that 60.6% of the progeny was amhy-positive, which suggested the presence of YY fish. We then conducted a second screening by qPCR in order to identify the individuals with two amhy copies in their genome. This screening revealed 13 individuals, all males, with values twice higher than the other 30 amhy-positive fishes, suggesting they have a YY complement. This assumption as well as the viability, fertility, and \"supermale\" nature of these individuals was confirmed in progeny tests with XX females that yielded 100% amhy-positive offspring. These results demonstrate that qPCR can obviate progeny test as a means to identify the genotypic sex and therefore may be useful for the survey of all three possible genotypes in wild populations.",

This study analysed water quality during the period of Planktothrix abundance (2007–2010) at the centre of Lake Kasumigaura and compared it to that in the succeeding period, which did not have Planktothrix blooms (2012–2015). The average phytoplankton biovolume during the abundance period was larger than that in the succeeding period, which would contribute to the high chemical oxygen demand (COD<SUB>Mn</SUB>; annual average of 9.7 mg/L) in the abundance period, compared to the succeeding period (7.6 mg/L). The total phosphorus concentration peaked in spring and summer in the abundance period, but only in summer in the succeeding period, whereas the seasonal variation in total nitrogen concentration between the two periods was relatively small. The annual average transparency (Secchi disc depth) increased before the abundance period due to a decrease in fixed suspended solid, which is comprised mainly of inorganic matter. It is likely that the change in irradiance conditions affected the occurrence of Planktothrix blooms.",

A questionnaire survey asked about respondents' proximity to the lake, their concerns about the lakes' uses and environments, their evaluations of the lakes, and their opinions regarding environmental improvements. The number of options chosen in response to the multiple-answer questions was used to measure the extent of concern. The results found that knowledge of the water environment, general environmental concerns, the amount of travel time to the lake, and the visiting interval were significantly related to concerns about the lake environment. The results of logistic regression analysis found that high environmental concerns positively influenced attitudes toward lake use.

Previously obtained Secchi depths (SDs) were somewhat underestimated by the proposed algorithms, and the ratio of the predicted SD to the measured SD changed with the ratio of tripton to chlorophyll a. A submodel was then built describing the ratio of scattering to backscattering based on the ratio of tripton to chlorophyll a (a trend supported by a number of previous reports) and applied to the prediction of SD in this lake. The model showed a gradually increasing trend at all stations in the predicted SD over the period, which was validated by the observations. The relationship between the measured and predicted SDs within a 2-day period was scattered, but showed a positive correlation at a significant level. In addition, this proposed method with the submodel describing the ratio of scattering to backscattering was applied to in situ reflectance spectra, and a correlation at a significant level was confirmed between the measured and predicted SDs.",

We compared genetic values and variances and broad-sense heritability across different sites in the lake. Results showed that the mean tolerance values to fenitrothion did not differ spatially. The variance in genetic value and heritability of fenitrothion tolerance significantly differed between sampling sites, revealing that long-term ecological risk of fenitrothion may differ between local populations in the lake.

      "abstract": "The chlorophyll-a (Chla) products of seven processors developed for the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor were evaluated. The seven processors, based on a neural network and band height, were assessed over an optically complex water body with Chla concentrations of 8.10-187.40 mg∙m<SUP>-3</SUP> using 10-year MERIS archival data. These processors were adopted for the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor. Results indicated that the four processors of band height (i.e., the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI_L1); and Fluorescence Line Height (FLH_L1)); neural network (i.e., Eutrophic Lake (EUL); and Case 2 Regional (C2R)) possessed reasonable retrieval accuracy with root mean square error (R<SUP>2</SUP>) in the range of 0.42-0.65. However, these processors underestimated the retrieved Chla &gt; 100 mg∙m<SUP>-3</SUP>, reflecting the limitation of the band height processors to eliminate the influence of non-phytoplankton matter and highlighting the need to train the neural network for highly turbid waters. MCI_L1 outperformed other processors during the calibration and validation stages (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.65, Root mean square error (RMSE) = 22.18 mg∙m<SUP>-3</SUP>, the mean absolute relative error (MARE) = 36.88%). In contrast, the results from the Boreal Lake (BOL) and Free University of Berlin (FUB) processors demonstrated their inadequacy to accurately retrieve Chla concentration &gt; 50 mg∙m<SUP>-3</SUP>, mainly due to the limitation of the training datasets that resulted in a high MARE for BOL (56.20%) and FUB (57.00%). Mapping the spatial distribution of Chla concentrations across Lake Kasumigaura using the seven processors showed that all processors—except for the BOL and FUB—were able to accurately capture the Chla distribution for moderate and high Chla concentrations. In addition, MCI_L1 and C2R processors were evaluated over 10-years of monthly measured Chla as they demonstrated the best retrieval accuracy from both groups (i.e., band height and neural network, respectively). The retrieved Chla of MCI_L1 was more accurate at tracking seasonal and annual variation in Chla than C2R, with only slight overestimation occurring during the springtime.",

      "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that mineralization of molybdenum unreactive phosphorus (MUP) in pore water is the major pathway for the changes in the concentration of molybdenum-reactive P (MRP) in pore water and inorganic P in sediment particles. The concentration of inorganic P in the sediment particles increased from December to April in Lake Kasumigaura, whereas concentrations of organic P in the sediment particles and MUP in pore water decreased. These results suggest that MUP mineralization plays a key role as the source of MRP, whereas desorption of inorganic P from the sediment particles into the pore water is a minor process. One-dimensional numerical simulation of sediment particles and the pore water supported the hypothesis. Diffusive flux of MUP was small in pore water, even in near-surface layers, so mineralization was the dominant process for changing the MUP concentration in the pore water. For MRP, diffusion was the dominant process in the surface layer, whereas adsorption onto the sediment was the dominant process in deeper layers. Researchers usually ignore organic P in the sediment, but organic P in sediment particles and the pore water is a key source of inorganic P in the sediment particles and pore water; our results suggest that in Lake Kasumigaura, organic P in the sediment is an important source, even at depths more than 1 cm below the sediment surface. In contrast, the large molecular size of MUP in pore water hampers diffusion of MUP from the sediment into the overlying water.",

      "abstract": "Although DNA barcoding is a promising tool for the identification of organisms, it requires the development of a specific reference sequence library for sample application. In the present study we developed a Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, zooplankton DNA barcode library to increase the sensitivity of future zooplankton monitoring for detecting lake ecosystem condition changes. Specifically, the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) haplotype, i.e., the primary DNA barcode, was examined for each zooplankton taxon. In crustaceans, 37 mtCOI haplotypes were obtained from 99 individuals, representing four and 15 morpho-species of Copepoda and Cladocera, respectively. Comparing these sequences with those in GenBank shows that the lake harbors putative non-indigenous species, such as Daphnia ambigua. In rotifers, 132 mtCOI haplotypes were obtained from 302 individuals, representing 11 genera and one unclassified taxon. The automatic barcode gap discovery (ABGD) algorithm separated these haplotypes into 43 species. Brachionus cf. calyciflorus was divided into five ABGD species, and different ABGD species tended to occur in different seasons. Seasonal ABGD-species succession was also observed within Polyarthra spp. and Synchaeta spp. These seasonal successions were not detected by inspections of external morphology alone. Accepting up to 7% sequence divergence within the same species, mtCOI reference sequences were available in GenBank for three, 13, and 17 species in Copepoda, Cladocera, and Rotifera, respectively. The present results, therefore, reveal the serious shortage of mtCOI reference sequences for rotifers, and underscore the urgency of developing rotifer mtCOI barcode libraries on a global scale.",

      "abstract": "Many approaches have been proposed for monitoring the eutrophication of Case 2 waters using remote sensing data. Semi-analytical algorithms and spectrum matching are two major approaches for chlorophyll-a (Chla) retrieval. Semi-analytical algorithms provide indices correlated with phytoplankton characteristics, (e.g., maximum and minimum absorption peaks). Algorithms' indices are correlated with measured Chla through the regression process. The main drawback of the semi-analytical algorithms is that the derived relation is location and data limited. Spectrum matching and the look-up table approach rely on matching the measured reflectance with a large library of simulated references corresponding to wide ranges of water properties. The spectral matching approach taking hyperspectral measured reflectance as an input, leading to difficulties in incorporating data from multispectral satellites. Consequently, multi-algorithm indices and the look-up table (MAIN-LUT) technique is proposed to combine the merits of semi-analytical algorithms and look-up table, which can be applied to multispectral data. Eight combinations of four algorithms (i.e., 2-band, 3-band, maximum chlorophyll index, and normalized difference chlorophyll index) are investigated for the MAIN-LUT technique. In situ measurements and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor data are used to validate MAIN-LUT. In general, the MAIN-LUT provide a comparable retrieval accuracy with locally tuned algorithms. The most accurate of the locally tuned algorithms varied among datasets, revealing the limitation of these algorithms to be applied universally. In contrast, the MAIN-LUT provided relatively high retrieval accuracy for Tokyo Bay (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.692, root mean square error (RMSE) = 21.4 mg m<SUP>-3</SUP>), Lake Kasumigaura (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.866, RMSE = 11.3 mg m<SUP>-3</SUP>), and MERIS data over Lake Kasumigaura (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.57, RMSE = 36.5 mg m<SUP>-3</SUP>). The simulated reflectance library of MAIN-LUT was generated based on inherent optical properties of Tokyo Bay; however, the MAIN-LUT also provided high retrieval accuracy for Lake Kasumigaura. MAIN-LUT could capture the spatial and temporal distribution of Chla concentration for Lake Kasumigaura.",

      "abstract": "Microscopic crustaceans (cladocerans and copepods) and rotifers are the principal zooplankton components of the pelagic food webs in lakes. They play important ecological roles, functioning as essential links between primary producers and planktivorous fish. Individuals zooplankton are important nodes of matter flow in pelagic ecosystems. The zooplankton community structure can provide useful indicators of top-down processes, such as the magnitude or strength of planktivorous predators and the extent of zooplankton grazing. Here we report the abundance of zooplankton taxa (crustaceans and rotifers) that were recorded monthly, from January 1980 to September 2015, at two stations on Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow eutrophic lake that is the second largest lake in Japan. The data include information on 12 copepod species (taxa), 20 cladoceran species (taxa), 40 rotifer species (taxa), and the opossum shrimp (Neomysis intermedia). In the 1980s, the plankton of the lake were characterized by cyanobacterial blooms and the co-dominance of Bosmina and Diaphanosoma in the summer. In addition, the two cladoceran genera, Daphnia galeata and Chydorus sphaericus were often prominent. The plankton profile changed dramatically in the middle (1997-2004) of the present long-term monitoring period, when cyanobacteria disappeared and diatoms became dominant even in the summer; concurrently, only the Diaphanosoma cladocerans were evident. However, in the past 10 years, cyanobacterial blooms, the co-dominance of Bosmina and Diaphanosoma, and D. galeata have re-emerged. Zooplankton monitoring forms part of the Lake Kasumigaura Long-Term Environmental Monitoring Program, which has been conducted by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) since 1977. Data on other planktonic components (phytoplankton and the elements of microbial food webs) noted during monitoring and on primary production were published in Takamura and Nakagawa (Ecol Res 27:8392012a, Ecol Res 27:837 2012b, Ecol Res 31:287 2016). Lake Kasumigaura is a core site of the Japan Long-term Ecological Research Network, a member of the International Long-term Ecological Research Network. Our quantitative dataset spanning several decades is unique in terms of the work on lakes and the plankton therein, and is freely available. The dataset has been used in ecological and environmental programs, as well as in studies on lake management.",

Results showed few differences in total phosphorus (TP) amount per unit area in overlying waters irrespective of the core thickness, and sums of TP in both overlying water and 0- to 2-cm sediment layers were nearly equal before and after the experiment, indicating that phosphorus was released mainly from the 0- to 2-cm layer by dissolution. In contrast, phosphorus was decreased in pore water below a 2-cm depth, probably through sorption to sediment solids. The citrate-dithionite-bicarbonate total phosphorus (CBD-TP) and non-reactive phosphorus extracted by NaOH (NaOH-NRP) in sediment solids in the 0- to 2-cm layer decreased during the experiment. The decreases of CBD-TP were 10 times higher than those of NaOH-NRP, suggesting that the released phosphorus came mainly from the fraction bound to iron in Lake Kasumigaura.",

We analyzed in shallow, eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura about whether the concentration of PP is controlled by biogenic P or resuspension of inorganic P in sediment. Increases in wind velocity and turbidity were observed when bottom shear stress exceeds the critical value for the lake. However, concentrations of PP, particulate inorgnaic P in PP (PIP), and particulate organic P in PP (POP) were not correlated with wind velocity. The POP concentration accounted for approximately 79% of the PP concentration, and the concentrations of PP, PIP, and POP were correlated with that of particulate organic carbon (POC). 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis clarified that mononucleotides accounted for the largest proportion among the detected P compound classes. Concentrations of mononucleotides, orthophosphate, and pyrophosphate were significantly higher in the samples with high POC concentrations, whereas the DNA-P concentration was not. The correlations suggest that biogenic P affects PP concentrations more strongly than does sediment resuspension. Furthermore, the 31P NMR analysis suggests that the production of biogenic P creates a pool of easily degradable P in shallow, eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura.",

Here, possible causes for increased C<SUB>D</SUB> values in near-calm conditions are examined using high quality datasets selected from three-year continuous measurements obtained from the centre of Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan. Based on our analysis, suggested causes including (i) measurement errors, (ii) lake currents, (iii) capillary waves, (iv) the possibility of a measurement height within the interfacial/transition sublayer, and (v) a possible mismatch in the representative time scale used for mean and covariance averaging, are not considered major factors. The use of vector-averaged, instead of scalar-averaged, wind speeds and the presence of waves only partially explain the increase in C<SUB>D</SUB> under light winds. A small increase in turbulent kinetic energy due to buoyant production at low wind speeds is identified as the likely major cause for this increase in C<SUB>D</SUB> in the unstable atmosphere dominant over inland water surfaces.",

Daily primary production was calculated by obtaining a P vs. E curve over a short-term incubation (approximately 1 h) in a water tank using in situ water temperature in the laboratory, based on the field conditions of the sampling date. The dataset has been used for ecological studies as well as for management studies on water quality and ecosystems.

In this study, we propose an improved AC algorithm named N-GWI (new standard Gordon and Wang's algorithms with an iterative process and a bio-optical model) for applying MERIS data to very turbid inland waters (i.e., waters with a water-leaving reflectance at 864.8 nm between 0.001 and 0.01). The N-GWI algorithm incorporates three improvements to avoid certain invalid assumptions that limit the applicability of the existing algorithms in very turbid inland waters. First, the N-GWI uses a fixed aerosol type (coastal aerosol) but permits aerosol concentration to vary at each pixel; this improvement omits a complicated requirement for aerosol model selection based only on satellite data. Second, it shifts the reference band from 670 nm to 754 nm to validate the assumption that the total absorption coefficient at the reference band can be replaced by that of pure water, and thus can avoid the uncorrected estimation of the total absorption coefficient at the reference band in very turbid waters. Third, the N-GWI generates a semi-analytical relationship instead of an empirical one for estimation of the spectral slope of particle backscattering. Our analysis showed that the N-GWI improved the accuracy of atmospheric correction in two very turbid Asian lakes (Lake Kasumigaura, Japan and Lake Dianchi, China), with a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of less than 22% for wavelengths longer than 620 nm. However, the N-GWI exhibited poor performance in moderately turbid waters (the NMAE values were larger than 83.6% in the four American coastal waters). The applicability of the N-GWI, which includes both advantages and limitations, was discussed.",

      "abstract": "Cyanobacterial bloom is a growing environmental problem in inland waters. In this study, we propose a method for monitoring levels of cyanobacterial blooms from Landsat/ETM+ images. The visual cyanobacteria index (VCI) is a simple index for in-situ visual interpretation of cyanobacterial blooms levels, by classifying them into six categories based on aggregation (e.g., subsurface blooms, surface scum). The floating algae index (FAI) and remote sensing reflectance in the red wavelength domain, which can be obtained from Landsat/ETM+ images, were related to the VCI for estimating cyanobacteria bloom levels from the Landsat/ETM+ images. Nine field campaigns were carried out at Lakes Nishiura and Kitaura (Lake Kasumigaura group), Japan, from June to August 2012. We also collected reflectance spectra at 20 stations for different VCI levels on August 3, 2012. The reflectance spectra were recalculated in correspondence to each ETM+ band, and used to calculate the FAI. The FAI values were then used to determine thresholds for classifying cyanobacterial blooms into different VCI levels. These FAI thresholds were validated using three Landsat/ETM+ images. Results showed that FAI values differed significantly at the respective VCI levels except between levels 1 and 2 (subsurface blooms) and levels 5 and 6 (surface scum and hyperscum). This indicated that the FAI was able to detect the high level of cyanobacteria that forms surface scum. In contrast, the Landsat/ETM+ band 3 reflectance could be used as an alternative index for distinguishing surface scum and hyperscum. Application of the thresholds for VCI classifications to three Landsat/ETM+ images showed that the volume of cyanobacterial blooms can be effectively classified into the six VCI levels.",

      "abstract": "Lake Kasumigaura, which is composed of the two basins (Nishiura and Kitaura), is a large, shallow, hypereutrophic lake. Phytoplankton and water quality records from the past forty years were analysed to elucidate whether or not, when, and what type of certain regime shifts may have occurred, based on using inferential regime shift detectors. Characteristics of the phytoplankton and water quality changes were similar at 6 sampling sites in the two basins, with 20 water quality parameters being classified into four groups, based on cluster analysis. Shifts in dominant plankton groups (DPGs) and water quality occurring almost concomitantly, concentration on the period from 1987 to 1992 (Shift A) and from 1997 to 2001 (Shift B), with those observed for the two basins usually being similar with small differences. Two types of inferential regime shift detectors (sequential t-test type; Rodionov's RSD and sequential F-test type: package strucchange in R) yielded similar timings and significances of the shifts. Furthermore, changes in skewness and conditional heteroskedasticity (package early warnings in R) usually represented early warning signals before the shifts. Correlation analysis and ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) vs. total phosphorus (TP) supported the hypothesis that phosphorus was the phytoplankton biomass limiting nutrient, except for one period for the Nishiura basin. Neither the nitrogen:phosphorus (N/P) ratio hypothesis and ammonia–nitrate (NH<SUB>4</SUB>-N/NO<SUB>3</SUB>-N) hypothesis satisfactorily explain the DPGs before and after Shift A (Microcystis spp. and Planktothrix spp., respectively), although it may be possible that these ratios triggered the DPG change in this shift. A considerable increase in silicon was observed for Shift B when the DPGs changed from cyanobacteria to diatoms. Further studies on the accurate types and triggers of the regime shifts are necessary to better understand the interactions between ecosystem and water quality for this and similar lakes elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "The paleohydrological information can become important to predict hydrological conditions in the future. In Japan, which hydrologically is characterized by relatively small catchment scales with steep relief of topography under humid temperate climatic conditions, the residence time of the groundwater should be relatively short. Thus the paleohydrological information preserved in the groundwater aquifer should also be limited compared with the continental aquifer. However, regarding groundwater in clay and silt sediments have low-permeability characteristic, archiving the paleohydrologic information at the time of deposition is expected. 　Therefore, in this study, cores were drilled into Holocene clay and silt deposits (Site K-1 and Site K-2) in the Lake Kasumigaurain Japan, where the depositional rate 10,000 years ago was rapid and it has been affected strongly by sea level changes including transgression and regression. By using the obtained core samples and extracted pore water from the cores, paleohydrologic information was investigated, and it was tried to understand hydrologic environments at the study area during a Holocene. In addition, groundwater flow and solute transport simulation were conducted to reproduce profiles of pore water. 　Results of investigation show that the profiles of pore water contents reflect sea level change and the difference in hydrological environment at that time at each site. The content of the paleo-brackish water in the culmination of transgression was about 14,000 mg/l in Cl-, -13.0‰ in δD and -2.6‰ in δ18O. It is allowed better understanding paleohydrological information by studying not only inorganic chemistry contents and stable isotopes of pore water and also the diatom fossils and groundwater flow and solute transport simulation. We will characterize the paleohydrological information of the study area acquired by those investigations and analysis.",

However, no individual solution fully agrees with coronal hole observations and in situ measurements of open flux at 1 au, as there is a strong deficit between the model and observations contributing to the known problem of the missing open flux. In this paper, we investigate the possible origin of the discrepancy between modeled and observed magnetic field topology by assessing the effect on the simulation output by the choice of the input boundary conditions and the simulation setup, including the choice of numerical schemes and the parameter initialization. In the frame of this work, we considered four potential field source surface-based models and one fully MHD model, different types of global magnetic field maps, and model initiation parameters. After assessing the model outputs using a variety of metrics, we conclude that they are highly comparable regardless of the differences set at initiation. When comparing all models to coronal hole boundaries extracted by extreme-ultraviolet filtergrams, we find that they do not compare well. This mismatch between observed and modeled regions of the open field is a candidate contributing to the open flux problem.",

The 4 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> extent of the slit in the north–south direction scanned the corona starting from the central meridian out to approximately 1.0 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> off the east limb throughout totality. The line widths and Doppler shifts of the Fe X (637.4 nm) and Fe XIV (530.3 nm) emission lines, characteristic of 1.1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> K and 1.8 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> K electron temperatures, respectively, varied across the different coronal structures intercepted by the slit. Fe XIV was the dominant emission in the closed fields of an active region and the base of a streamer, with relatively constant 20–30 km s<SUP>‑1</SUP> line widths independent of the height. In contrast, Fe X emission exhibited broader (&gt;40 km s<SUP>‑1</SUP>) line widths in open fields, which increased with height, in particular in the polar coronal hole. Inferences of line widths and Doppler shifts were consistent with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrograph, as well as with the near-infrared Fe XIII 1074 nm line observed by Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter. The differences in the spectral line widths between distinct coronal structures are interpreted as an indication of the predominance of wave heating in open structures versus localized heating in closed structures. This study underscores the unparalleled advantages and the enormous potential of TSE spectroscopy in measuring line widths simultaneously in open and closed fields at high altitudes, with minimal exposure times, stray light levels, and instrumental widths.",

Sulfur dioxide, often used as a marker of volcanic activity in Earth's atmosphere, has been observed since late 1970s to exhibit variability at the Venus' cloud tops at time scales from hours to decades; however, this variability may be associated with solely atmospheric processes. Water vapor is identified as a particularly valuable tracer for volcanic plumes because it can be mapped from orbit at three different tropospheric altitude ranges, and because of its apparent low background variability. We note that volcanic gas plumes could be either enhanced or depleted in water vapor compared to the background atmosphere, depending on magmatic volatile composition. Non-gaseous components of volcanic plumes, such as ash grains and/or cloud aerosol particles, are another investigation target of orbital and in situ measurements. We discuss expectations of in situ and remote measurements of volcanic plumes in the atmosphere with particular focus on the upcoming DAVINCI, EnVision and VERITAS missions, as well as possible future missions.",

      "abstract": "The tendency for low-speed solar wind to show greater spatiotemporal variability and different compositional properties from high-speed wind has led to the prevailing idea of a bimodal solar wind, in which fast wind comes from coronal holes and slow wind comes from coronal streamers. We present observational evidence that most of the slow wind originates from small coronal holes or from just inside the boundaries of large holes, with the rest leaking out from coronal streamers and confined to the immediate vicinity of the heliospheric current and plasma sheets. Although this conclusion was suggested earlier by extrapolations of photospheric field maps, additional support comes from (1) observations of slow wind at Earth following the central-meridian passage of small equatorial holes; (2) observations of slow wind with high Alfvénicity at 1 au by Wind, and more recently near the Sun by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter; and (3) the finding that 80% of the solar wind observed by Helios at 0.3 – 0.4 au during 1974 – 1978 was Alfvénic. We show that compositional properties such as charge-state ratios vary over the solar cycle and may depend on parameters such as the footpoint field strength B0, and thus cannot be used alone to distinguish between coronal hole and noncoronal-hole wind. Finally, we note that magnetograms greatly underestimate the amount of small-scale flux emerging inside coronal holes and other unipolar regions. If this rate is taken to be the same as in the quiet Sun, the energy flux density resulting from interchange reconnection with open field lines is on the order of 3×105 erg cm<SUP>‑2</SUP> s<SUP>‑1</SUP> (B0/10 G), sufficient to drive the solar wind. The wind speed depends on the rate of flux-tube expansion, with slower expansion leading to more energy deposition at greater heights and faster wind.",

      "abstract": "The distribution of Mars ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) is well established; however, our knowledge on the dayside diurnal variation of O<SUB>3</SUB> is limited. We present measurements of Mars O<SUB>3</SUB> column abundances, spanning Mars Year (MY) 34 to the end of MY 36, by the Ultraviolet and VIsible Spectrometer (UVIS), part of the Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery (NOMAD) instrument, aboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. UVIS provides the capability to measure dayside diurnal variations of O<SUB>3</SUB> and for the first time, a characterization of the dayside diurnal variations of O<SUB>3</SUB> is attempted. The observed O<SUB>3</SUB> climatology for Mars Years (MY) 34-36 follows the established seasonal trends observed through previous O<SUB>3</SUB> measurements. At aphelion, the equatorial O<SUB>3</SUB> distribution is observed to be strongly correlated with the water ice distribution. We show that the early dust storm in MY 35 resulted in a near-global reduction in O<SUB>3</SUB> during northern spring and the O<SUB>3</SUB> abundances remained 14% lower in northern summer compared to MY36. Strong latitudinal and longitudinal variation was observed in the diurnal behavior of O<SUB>3</SUB> around the northern summer solstice. In areas with a weak O<SUB>3</SUB> upper layer, O<SUB>3</SUB> column abundance peaks in the mid-morning, driven by changes in the near-surface O<SUB>3</SUB> layer. In regions with greater O<SUB>3</SUB> column abundances, O<SUB>3</SUB> is observed to gradually increase throughout the day. This is consistent with the expected diurnal trend of O<SUB>3</SUB> above the hygropause and suggests that in these areas an upper O<SUB>3</SUB> layer persists throughout the Martian day.",

      "abstract": "The study of planets and small bodies within our Solar System is fundamental for understanding the formation and evolution of the Earth and other planets. Compositional and meteorological studies of the giant planets provide a foundation for understanding the nature of the most commonly observed exoplanets, while spectroscopic observations of the atmospheres of terrestrial planets, moons, and comets provide insights into the past and present-day habitability of planetary environments, and the availability of the chemical ingredients for life. While prior and existing (sub)millimeter observations have led to major advances in these areas, progress is hindered by limitations in the dynamic range, spatial and temporal coverage, as well as sensitivity of existing telescopes and interferometers. Here, we summarize some of the key planetary science use cases that factor into the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a proposed 50-m class single dish facility: (1) to more fully characterize planetary wind fields and atmospheric thermal structures, (2) to measure the compositions of icy moon atmospheres and plumes, (3) to obtain detections of new, astrobiologically relevant gases and perform isotopic surveys of comets, and (4) to perform synergistic, temporally-resolved measurements in support of dedicated interplanetary space missions. The improved spatial coverage (several arcminutes), resolution (~ 1.2'' − 12''), bandwidth (several tens of GHz), dynamic range (~ 105) and sensitivity (~ 1 mK km s−1) required by these science cases would enable new insights into the chemistry and physics of planetary environments, the origins of prebiotic molecules and the habitability of planetary systems in general.",

Fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves are clearly distinguished in observations. Properties of coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves are determined by local parameters of the plasma, including the field-aligned filamentation typical for the corona. It makes coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves reliable probes of the coronal plasma structures by the method of magnetohydrodynamic seismology. For example, propagating slow waves indicate the local direction of the guiding magnetic field. Standing, sloshing and propagating slow waves can be used for probing the coronal heating function and the polytropic index. Kink oscillations of coronal plasma loops provide us with estimations of the absolute value of the magnetic field in oscillating plasma loops. This tutorial introduces several techniques of magnetohydrodynamic seismology of solar coronal plasmas. It includes the description of practical steps in the data acquisition, pre-processing, and processing using the open-access data of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, and elaborated data analysis techniques of motion magnification and Bayesian statistics.",

The next generation of ultraviolet spectrographs (UVS) on board ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer and NASA's Europa Clipper missions will perform such measurements of Jupiter and its moons in the early 2030s. This work presents a compilation of a detailed UV stellar catalog, named Catalog of Ultraviolet Bright Stars (CUBS), of targets with high intensity in the 50–210 nm wavelength range with applications relevant to planetary spectroscopy. These applications include (1) planning and simulating occultations, including calibration measurements; (2) modeling starlight illumination of dark, nightside planetary surfaces primarily lit by the sky; and (3) studying the origin of diffuse Galactic UV light as mapped by existing data sets from Juno-UVS and others. CUBS includes observations from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and additional information from the SIMBAD database. We have constructed model spectra at 0.1 nm resolution for almost 90,000 targets using interpolated Kurucz models (which have a resolution of 1 nm) and, when available, IUE spectra. CUBS also includes robust checks for agreement between the Kurucz models and the IUE data. We also present a tool for which our catalog can be used to identify the best candidates for stellar occultation observations, with applications for any UV instrument. We report on our methods for producing CUBS and discuss plans for its implementation during ongoing and upcoming planetary missions.",

The data analysis showed a clear effect in the variations of f<SUB>o</SUB>F2 (and, accordingly, N<SUB>m</SUB>F2): during the SE, f<SUB>o</SUB>F2 decreased, and 5 min after the time of maximum eclipse, began to increase to its usual level. From the beginning of the SE, h<SUB>m</SUB>F2 decreased from 285 to 255 km, and then it began to grow with a maximum near the time of maximum obscuration. To study longitudinal effects and clarify contributions of different factors to the observed temporal variations of the ionospheric parameters, the results of observations of the ionosphere over Kharkiv were compared with the data obtained by the ionosonde in Pruhonice (Czech Republic, 50.0° N, 14.6° E). The N<SUB>m</SUB>F2 electron density decreased due to SE by the factor of 1.46 in Kharkiv, in contrast to 1.33 times in Pruhonice. Comparison of data in universal time (UT) showed a coincidence in the nature and time of fluctuations in both f<SUB>o</SUB>F2 and h<SUB>m</SUB>F2 observed in Kharkiv and Pruhonice on 25 October. Variations in h<SUB>m</SUB>F2 caused by SE in Kharkiv and Pruhonice were identical. The SE was accompanied by a plasma flow from the plasmasphere to the ionosphere. The flux density change was about -2 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> m<SUP>-2</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP> and about 0 for Kharkiv and Pruhonice, respectively. The obtained value of the vertical velocity (tens of meters per second) for Kharkiv is the typical velocity for the mid-latitude F2 layer of the ionosphere. It was confirmed that in addition to typical SE effects, results of observations of the ionosphere over Kharkiv on October 25, 2022 had individual features.",

Life may have emerged in similar environments elsewhere in the Solar System and beyond. The ongoing search for life elsewhere mainly focuses on those environments most likely to support life, now or in the past—that is, potentially habitable environments. Discussion of habitability is necessarily based on what we know about life on Earth, as it is our only example. This chapter gives an overview of the known and presumed requirements for life on Earth and discusses how these requirements can be used to assess the potential habitability of planetary bodies across the Solar System and beyond. We first consider the chemical requirements of life and potential feedback effects that the presence of life can have on habitable conditions, and then the planetary, stellar, and temporal requirements for habitability. We then review the state of knowledge on the potential habitability of bodies across the Solar System and exoplanets, with a particular focus on Mars, Venus, Europa, and Enceladus. While reviewing the case for the potential habitability of each body, we summarize the most prominent and impactful studies that have informed the perspective on where habitable environments are likely to be found.",

The main results are summarized as follows: (a) The 2-D TEC responses exhibited distinct latitudinal differences. The mid-latitude ionosphere exhibited a more substantial TEC decrease of 25%-40% along with an extended recovery time of 3-4 hr. In contrast, the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere experienced a smaller TEC reduction of 10%-25% and a faster recovery time of 20-50 min. The minimal eclipse effect was observed near the northern equatorial ionization anomaly crest region. (b) The ionospheric electron density variations during the eclipse were effectively reconstructed by TIDAS data assimilation in the 3-D domain, providing important altitude information with validity. (c) The ionospheric electron density variations showed a notable altitude-dependent feature. The eclipse led to a substantial electron density reduction of 30%-50%, with the maximum depletion occurring around the ionospheric F2-layer peak height (hmF2) of 250-350 km. The post-eclipse recovery of electron density exhibited a relatively slower pace near the F2-layer peak height than that at lower and higher altitudes.",

      "abstract": "On 26 December 2019, an annular solar eclipse occurred in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent, which falls within the Equatorial ElectroJet (EEJ) region. This presented an opportunity to study the effects of a high-obscuration annular solar eclipse (93.3%) and of the special tides that accompany an eclipse. Eclipses are known to affect the electrodynamics of the equatorial region and the distribution of plasma in the low-latitude ionosphere. On December 26, 2019, different phenomena were indeed seen over different time scales. Around the time of the eclipse, there was a depletion in the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere, as inferred from GNSS receiver systems placed along the eclipse path in and around the EEJ region. Magnetometer measurements indicated a weakening of the EEJ current in this area not just when the eclipse took place but for the rest of the day as well. Observations from a digital-ionosonde located in Trivandrum (8.52 ° N, 76.94 ° E; 0.33 ° N dip-latitude) revealed that the ionospheric F-layer moved downwards just after obscurity maximum. Shortly after the F region was observed to move back upward, a one-hour long strong blanketing sporadic E-layer was triggered even though there was only a weakening of the EEJ but no reversal in the associated magnetic perturbations. Simulations from our quasi-two dimensional model clearly show that though there was no Counter Electrojet, there was indeed a weakening of the zonal field on 26 December 2019 during the eclipse and the post-eclipse period. The overall weakening trend lasted until late afternoon. Other notable features were uncovered on a time scale of several hours after the passage of the eclipse. While the day-long weakening of the EEJ is consistent with special tides related to the lunar trajectory, we also observed unusually large amplitude undulations in both vertical-TEC and F<SUB>2</SUB>-region peak plasma density over a five-hour time scale, starting around 2:00 PM LT. These undulations were consistent with the zonal electric field variations reconstructed from the magnetometer data.",

In this work, we investigate the nadir observations of the NOMAD infrared channel from the Martian Years 34 to 36 (Mars 2018 to December 2022), especially for CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice detection. Based on Oliva et al. (2022), we present an updated method taking advantage of the 2.7 μm absorption band for surface ice detection by selecting the diffraction orders 190, 169, 168 and 167. We focus the analysis on the Southern polar cap and define its boundaries during its sublimation phase in MY34-36. Globally, seasonal changes seem repeatable for MY34-36. Moreover, we show the potential of the 2.29 μm absorption band for surface CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice identification through the diffraction order 193. We define a pseudo-band depth as a good proxy for CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice detection. Following a semi-qualitative approach, we attempt to reproduce such spectra by using the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) model in order to estimate CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice equivalent grain size. For the selected periods, the estimations are in the order of centimetres, which is in agreement with previous studies using spectral observations of OMEGA, CRISM and TES instruments.",

Its volume mixing ratio (VMR) shows a seasonal increase of up to 5 ppbv during the perihelion season, followed by a sudden drop to undetectable levels, contradicting modelling estimates of the HCl lifetime of several months. In the Earth's stratosphere, heterogeneous uptake of HCl onto water ice is known to be a major sink for this species. This reaction is now also considered when modelling HCl abundances in the Martian atmosphere. In this work, we use simultaneous measurements of water ice and HCl obtained by the ACS instrument to find particular structures in the vertical profiles as detached gas layers at ice-free altitudes (\"ice-holes\"). From these particular examples we conclude that the heterogeneous uptake of HCl onto water ice operates on Mars and is a fast mechanism regulating the HCl abundance in the atmosphere of Mars.",

Direct observations of the formation of streamer blobs could be a proxy for understanding the formation of small-scale structures and disturbances in the solar wind. <BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate how a streamer blob is formed before it is observed in the outer corona. <BR /> Methods: Using special coordinated observations from SOHO/LASCO, GOES/SUVI, and SDO/AIA, we studied the precursors of a streamer blob seen in the corona below 2.0 solar radii (R<SUB>⊙</SUB>). <BR /> Results: We find that the streamer blob formed due to the gradual merging of three clumps of brightenings initiated from the lower corona at about 1.8 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, which was likely driven by the expansion of the loop system at the base of the streamer. The acceleration of the blob starts at 1.9 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> or lower. It propagates along the south flank of the streamer, where an expanding elongated brightening occurs coincidentally. <BR /> Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate that formation of a streamer blob is a complex process. We suggest that the expansion of the loop results in a pinching-off flux-rope-like blob at the loop apex below 2 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. When the blob moves outward, it can be transferred across the overlying loops through interchange or component magnetic reconnection and is then released into the open field system. When the blob moves toward open field lines, interchange magnetic reconnection might also occur, and that can accelerate the plasma blob intermittently, while allowing it to transfer across the open field lines. Such dynamics in a streamer blob might further trigger small-scale disturbances in the solar wind such as switchbacks in the inner heliosphere. <P />Movies associated to Figs. 2, 3, 6, and 9 are available at <A href=\"https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202347785/olm\">https://www.aanda.org</A>.",

Both objects have high albedo surfaces that are rich in methane ice, with a texture that permits long optical path lengths through the ice for solar photons. There is evidence for N<SUB>2</SUB> ice absorption around 4.2 μm on Eris, though not on Makemake. No CO ice absorption is seen at 4.67 μm on either body. For the first time, absorption bands of two heavy isotopologues of methane are observed at 2.615 μm (<SUP>13</SUP>CH<SUB>4</SUB>), 4.33 μm (<SUP>12</SUP>CH<SUB>3</SUB>D), and 4.57 μm (<SUP>12</SUP>CH<SUB>3</SUB>D). These bands enable us to measure D/H ratios of (2.5 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> and (2.9 ± 0.6) × 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, along with <SUP>13</SUP>C/<SUP>12</SUP>C ratios of 0.012 ± 0.002 and 0.010 ± 0.003 in the surface methane ices of Eris and Makemake, respectively. The measured D/H ratios are much lower than that of presumably primordial methane in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, but they are similar to D/H ratios in water in many comets and larger outer solar system objects. This similarity suggests that the hydrogen atoms in methane on Eris and Makemake originated from water, indicative of geochemical processes in past or even ongoing hot environments in their deep interiors. The <SUP>13</SUP>C/<SUP>12</SUP>C ratios are consistent with commonly observed solar system values, suggesting no substantial enrichment in <SUP>13</SUP>C as could happen if the methane currently on their surfaces was the residue of a much larger inventory that had mostly been lost to space. Possible explanations include geologically recent outgassing from the interiors as well as processes that cycle the surface methane inventory to keep the uppermost surfaces refreshed.",

      "abstract": "Vertical distribution of water vapor in the Martian lower atmosphere (0-40 km) is an important characteristic of the Martian water cycle. It reflects a complex interplay between various processes shaping the contemporary water cycle, including atmospheric transport, formation of water ice clouds, sublimation of surface frost, and possible interaction with the subsurface. Despite the growing dataset of water vapor observations, there is yet no comprehensive climatology of the vertical distribution of vapor. Limb and solar occultation observations that are typically used to retrieve vapor vertical distribution are much less numerous than nadir observations and are available for limited seasons and locations. We propose a new methodology to retrieve vertical distribution of water vapor in the Martian lower atmosphere using only nadir data. The methodology is based on the observation that infrared spectra collected over same location during different parts of day are sensitive to water vapor in different parts of the atmosphere. We validate our new methodology by applying it to infrared spectra simulated for realistic Mars environments created with Mars General Circulation Model (GCM). These tests show that vertical profiles of vapor can be recovered with accuracy ∼20-40%, which is comparable to accuracy of limb and occultation observations. Importantly, the new retrieval algorithm can constrain near-surface (0-10 km) vapor abundances that cannot be observed by limb and occultation techniques. Application of this new methodology to a large dataset on Martian nadir spectra, such as the one collected by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) onboard Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) during its mission in 1999-2004, can result in the development of the detailed climatology of vapor vertical distribution on Mars. As an initial step toward this goal, we apply the new retrieval methodology to a subset of nadir spectra collected by MGS TES during one Martian year. The retrieved vapor profiles are qualitatively consistent with vapor distributions predicted by the GCM for different seasons. Differences between retrieved and simulated profiles can be interpreted as reflecting wetter Martian atmosphere and weaker atmospheric transport, during some seasons. Retrieved vapor distribution during southern summer suggests disruption of atmospheric vapor transport into southern extra-tropics following a global dust storm.",

Previously, a floor of ∼2.8 nT had been proposed for the solar wind (SW) magnetic field strength (B). F <SUB>10.7</SUB>, which closely tracks the Sun's unsigned photospheric magnetic flux, and SW B exhibit different relationships to their floors at 11 yr solar minima during the last ∼50 yr. While F <SUB>10.7</SUB> approaches 67 sfu at each minimum, the corresponding SW B is offset above ∼2.8 nT by an amount approximately proportional to the solar polar field strength—which varied by a factor of ∼2.5 during this interval. This difference is substantiated by ∼130 yr of reconstructed F <SUB>10.7</SUB> (via the range of the diurnal variation of the East-component (rY) of the geomagnetic field) and SW B (based on the interdiurnal variability geomagnetic activity index). For the last ∼60 yr, the contribution of the slow SW to SW B has exhibited a floor-like behavior at ∼2 nT, in contrast to the contributions of coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams that vary with the solar cycle. These observations, as well as recent SW studies based on Parker Solar Probe and Solar Dynamics Observatory data, suggest that (1) the Sun has a small-scale turbulent dynamo that is independent of the 11 yr sunspot cycle; and (2) the small-scale magnetic fields generated by this nonvarying turbulent dynamo maintain a constant open flux carried to the heliosphere by the Sun's floor-like slow SW.",

Early study with three channels of SPICAV/SOIR instrument using a few selected orbits indicated presence of two aerosol modes in particle size distribution (Wilquet et al., 2009). Analysis of aerosol properties from the SPICAV-IR spectrometer for the whole Venus Express data set obtained from May 2006 till November 2014 has proved it for some occultations (Luginin et al., 2016). In this work, we report retrieval of the upper haze (81-100 km) aerosol properties from 101 simultaneous SPICAV-UV and -IR solar occultation sessions acquired between March 2007 and January 2013. A joint analysis of the data from two spectrometers allowed us to characterize the size distribution ∼10 km higher in the atmosphere compared to previous analysis and to detect bimodal distribution in ∼50% of observations previously believed to be unimodal. At altitudes 81-92 km bimodality is observed in &gt;50% of cases. Mode 2 particles are detected up to 98 km and mode 1 up to 100 km.

      "abstract": "We propose a mechanism for the excitation of large-scale quasiperiodic fast-propagating magnetoacoustic (QFP) waves observed on both sides of the coronal mass ejection. Through a series of numerical experiments, we successfully simulated the quasi-static evolution of the equilibrium locations of the magnetic flux rope in response to the change of the background magnetic field, as well as the consequent loss of the equilibrium that eventually gives rise to the eruption. During the eruption, we identified QFP waves propagating radially outward of the flux rope, and tracing their origin reveals that they result from the disturbance within the flux rope. Acting as an imperfect waveguide, the flux rope allows the internal disturbance to escape to the outside successively via its surface, invoking the observed QFP waves. Furthermore, we synthesized the images of QFP waves on the basis of the data given by our simulations and found consistency with observations. This indicates that the leakage of the disturbance outside the flux rope could be a reasonable mechanism for QFP waves.",

Satellite cloud retrievals have so far not taken into account the lunar shadow, hindering a reliable spaceborne assessment of the eclipse-induced cloud evolution. Here we use satellite cloud measurements during three solar eclipses between 2005 and 2016 that have been corrected for the partial lunar shadow together with large-eddy simulations to analyze the eclipse-induced cloud evolution. Our corrected data reveal that, over cooling land surfaces, shallow cumulus clouds start to disappear at very small solar obscurations (~15%). Our simulations explain that the cloud response was delayed and was initiated at even smaller solar obscurations. We demonstrate that neglecting the disappearance of clouds during a solar eclipse could lead to a considerable overestimation of the eclipse-related reduction of net incoming solar radiation. These findings should spur cloud model simulations of the direct consequences of sunlight-intercepting geoengineering proposals, for which our results serve as a unique benchmark.",

The daytime limb observations by the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft are of hydroxyl (OH) prompt emission near 308 nm, which is excited directly from the photodissociation of water vapor by the solar Lyman-α flux. Average IUVS daytime water vapor densities near 130 km are 3 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>−3</SUP> around perihelion. The water vapor densities diurnally vary with a peak near midday and no detection at sunrise and sunset. To evaluate the large daytime water vapor densities for self-consistency, we also report the simultaneous observation of OH solar fluorescence emission near 308 nm in the thermosphere, which enables the retrieval of OH densities. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model initialized with the daytime IUVS water vapor densities, modeled peak OH densities are in good agreement with the observed IUVS peak OH densities. Because the observed thermospheric temperatures are controlled by solar insolation and cross the water frost point during the day, we suggest that the IUVS observed water vapor is created by the daily sublimation of water ice particles supplied from below. We discuss the implications of the IUVS observations on the present day loss of water vapor from Mars in the form of atomic hydrogen.",

Recently, the infrared transmission spectra recorded by the Fourier transform instrument on the ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment) satellite has provided measurements of PSC composition. We report on coincident observations made by the CALIPSO and the ACE satellites for three late winter periods (2016, 2018 and 2019) and evaluate CALIPSO's determination of PSC composition relative to ACE's findings. We found that CALIPSO and ACE generally agree well for the detection of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) clouds. However, CALIPSO detects some NAT clouds where ACE detects supercooled ternary solutions of nitric and sulfuric acid (STS). Similarly, CALIPSO only partially detects ice in ACE's ice clouds. Overall, these results seem to show that CALIPSO's NAT classification might be too inclusive. We also found that supercooled nitric acid (SNA) clouds, a new classification, are labelled as STS by CALIPSO.",

For this, we draw azimuth–time images of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission of 171 Å band observed by the SDO/AIA and white light (WL) observed by the SOHO/LASCO C2 in 2020 July. From the azimuth–time image, we define two tracks in which the EUV intensities were recurrently enhanced during two weeks. The two EUV tracks are rooted at 78.°8 and 81.°4 latitudes, but their projected azimuth angles are changed with time as the Sun rotates. Coherent WL tracks at different altitudes are determined by scaling the azimuth angles of the EUV tracks, accounting for the effect of inclination of coronal rays. From this, we construct time–distance images of WL intensities along WL tracks, whose projected azimuth angle changes along time and altitude, but the intensities are correlated with the EUV intensities measured below. The time–distance images of WL show repeated and inclined intensity features. The propagation speeds in the altitude range 2.3–6 solar radii are calculated to be 159 ± 8 km s<SUP>‑1</SUP> and 300 ± 24 km s<SUP>‑1</SUP>. The EUV and WL intensities are found to be coherent at 1–2 day periods. It is also found that dynamic burst events along the EUV track are responsible for the enhanced emission. We conclude that the variation of the WL intensity along the polar coronal rays is related with the evolution of the EUV intensity below.",

Previous observations have shown significant discrepancies regarding the vapor distribution in the boundary layer, drawing conflicting conclusions as to whether water is uniformly mixed below the cloud condensation height, or whether water is mostly confined in the near surface layer. We conclude that the uniformly well-mixed assumption for water vapor up to the cloud condensation level is not always compatible with observational constraints, particularly when peak near-surface water vapor abundances are observed during L<SUB>s</SUB> = 110°-120°. The uniformly well-mixed assumption leads to an over-estimation of the total water vapor column abundances between L<SUB>s</SUB> = 80°-120°, and an under-estimation of the total water vapor column abundances between L<SUB>s</SUB> = 120°-150°. The overestimation of vapor in the column is particularly evident during peak surface water vapor pressures (∼L<SUB>s</SUB> = 110°-120°), suggesting a concentration of water vapor at the surface that actively participates in subsurface exchange. Using both TECP and column vapor abundance as constraints for the vertical vapor distribution, the maximum height of the well-mixed vapor layer ranges between ∼3.5-13.5 km, all of which falls below the cloud condensation height for the corresponding season. From L<SUB>s</SUB> = 120° to 150°, the maximum height of the well-mixed layer stays fairly consistent at a mean height of ∼7 km. These results are particularly important for providing insight into the seasonal transport of water and the role of regolith-atmospheric exchange.",

Fast magnetoacoustic waves, guided by coronal plasma non-uniformities, exhibit strong geometric dispersion, forming quasi-periodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave trains. QFP wave trains are observed in extreme-ultraviolet imaging data and indirectly in microwaves and low-frequency radio, aiding in understanding the magnetic connectivity, energy, and mass transport in the corona. However, measuring the field-aligned group speed of QFP wave trains, as a key parameter for seismological analysis, is challenging due to strong dispersion and associated rapid evolution of the wave train envelope. We demonstrate that the group speed of QFP wave trains formed in plane low-β coronal plasma non-uniformities can be assessed through the propagation of the wave train's effective centre of mass, referred to as the wave train's centroid speed. This centroid speed, as a potential observable, is shown empirically to correspond to the group speed of the most energetic Fourier harmonic in the wave train. The centroid speed is found to be almost insensitive to the waveguide density contrast with the ambient corona, and to vary with the steepness of the transverse density profile. The discrepancy between the centroid speed as the group speed measure and the phase speed at the corresponding wavelength is shown to reach 70 per cent, which is crucial for the energy flux estimation and interpretation of observations.",

We compare the evolution of water vapor abundances, dust opacity and surface temperatures in the Southern Polar Region (SPR) during GDS years of MY25, MY28, and MY34 relative to years without GDS. During all GDS years, the vapor abundances decrease in the lower atmosphere in the SPR following the storm. Our results suggest that this decrease could be the result of disruption of the southward transport of vapor by atmospheric circulation. Alternatively, the decrease in vapor abundances could be caused by decreased desorption of vapor from the subsurface.",

      "abstract": "Dusty plasmas are electrically quasi-neutral media that, along with electrons, ions, neutral gas, radiation, and electric and/or magnetic fields, also contain solid or liquid particles with sizes ranging from a few nanometers to a few micrometers. These media can be found in many natural environments as well as in various laboratory setups and industrial applications. As a separate branch of plasma physics, the field of dusty plasma physics was born in the beginning of 1990s at the intersection of the interests of the communities investigating astrophysical and technological plasmas. An additional boost to the development of the field was given by the discovery of plasma crystals leading to a series of microgravity experiments of which the purpose was to investigate generic phenomena in condensed matter physics using strongly coupled complex (dusty) plasmas as model systems. Finally, the field has gained an increasing amount of attention due to its inevitable connection to the development of novel applications ranging from the synthesis of functional nanoparticles to nuclear fusion and from particle sensing and diagnostics to nano-contamination control. The purpose of the present perspectives paper is to identify promising new developments and research directions for the field. As such, dusty plasmas are considered in their entire variety: from classical low-pressure noble-gas dusty discharges to atmospheric pressure plasmas with aerosols and from rarefied astrophysical plasmas to dense plasmas in nuclear fusion devices. Both fundamental and application aspects are covered.",

      "abstract": "Total solar eclipses (TSEs) are impressive astronomical events that have attracted people's curiosity since ancient times. Their abrupt alterations to the radiation balance have stimulated studies on “eclipse meteorology,” most of them documenting events in the Northern Hemisphere while only one TSE (23 November 2003) has been described over Antarctica. On 4 December 2021-just a few days before the austral summer solstice-the moon blocked the sun over the austral high latitudes, with the path of totality arching from the Weddell Sea to the Amundsen Sea, thus producing a ∼2-min central TSE. In this work we present high-resolution meteorological observations from Union Glacier Camp (80°S, 83°W), the only location with a working station under totality, and South Pole station. These observations were complemented with meteorological records from 37 surface stations across Antarctica. Notably, the largest cooling (∼5°C) was observed over the East Antarctic dome, where obscurity was ∼85% while many sectors experienced insignificant temperature changes. This heterogenous cooling distribution, at odds with the seemingly homogeneous land surface of Antarctica, is partially captured by a simple radiative model. To further diagnose the effect of the eclipse on the surface meteorology, we ran multiple pairs of simulations (eclipse enabled and disabled) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The overall pattern and magnitude of the simulated cooling agree well with the observations and reveal that, in addition to the solar radiation deficit and cloud cover, low-level winds and the height of the planetary boundary layer are key determinants of the temperature changes and their spatial variability.",

The progress in Titan's photochemistry, stimulated by the very successful Cassini-Huygens mission, facilitated photochemical interpretation of Pluto's atmosphere that was observed by the New Horizons mission and supporting ground-based measurements. Here is an update of Triton's atmospheric and ionospheric photochemistry that combines the previous photochemical model (Krasnopolsky and Cruikshank 1995, Photochemistry of Triton's atmosphere and ionosphere, J. Geophys. Res. 100, 21,271-21,286) with findings in Titan's and Pluto's photochemistry and progress in chemical kinetics. <P />Our modeling of Triton's photochemistry is restricted to the conditions of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, when data on vertical profiles of temperature, haze, and densities of N<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, N, and electrons were obtained using radio- and solar UVS occultations and imaging. <P />Significant differences between the composition and photochemistry of Triton's atmosphere and those of Titan and Pluto are mostly caused by the low CH<SUB>4</SUB> tropospheric abundance of 100 ppm, smaller than those on Titan and Pluto by two orders of magnitude. This methane is strongly depleted photochemically to a ppb level in the upper atmosphere of Triton, while it is enriched by diffusive separation on Titan and Pluto. Therefore atomic species and their chemistry are much more abundant on Triton than on Titan and Pluto. Atomic ions C<SUP>+</SUP> and N<SUP>+</SUP> with slow recombination rates dominate in Triton's ionosphere with electron densities, significantly exceeding those on Titan and Pluto. <P />The proposed model agrees with all observational constraints and presumes thermal escape of H<SUB>2</SUB> + H with a rate of 45 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP> Byr<SUP>-1</SUP>, loss of nitrogen of 40 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP> Byr<SUP>-1</SUP> on thermal escape and precipitation of nitriles, and sublimation and loss of methane of 270 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP> Byr<SUP>-1</SUP>. <P />C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>6</SUB> and HCN are minor species in the photochemical precipitations on Triton, and their detection in Triton's ice may refer to either the primordial composition or ice photochemistry. <P />Seven versions of the model are calculated to study its sensitivity to some basic input parameters. The model can be used for planning future studies of Triton's atmosphere. An analog of the Ion-Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard Triton's orbiter looks promising.",

The 3DCIT-derived electron density (Ne) difference between the eclipse and quiet days showed that the Ne depletion was between 200 and 550 km and the maximum magnitude was about −3.0 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> el/m<SUP>3</SUP> which was at 280 km in altitude. The contributions from below 250 and 350 km altitudes to Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) depletion were ∼30% and ∼60%, respectively. Significant asymmetry of Ne depletion with respect to the eclipse path was captured in 3DCIT results, and the deviation conditions between the Ne depletion central line and eclipse path varied at different altitudes. Simulations with the thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model generally showed consistent ionospheric variations with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) VTEC and 3DCIT electron density. Furthermore, term analysis on the ion continuity equation indicates that the asymmetry of Ne depletion was mainly induced by the neutral wind disturbance which converged toward the eclipse region and caused opposite transport effects on both sides of the eclipse path. The thermospheric composition was also changed by disturbed neutral wind and impacted plasma production and loss rates, contributing to the Ne depletion asymmetry.",

      "abstract": "NOMAD is a suite of spectrometers on the board of the ESA-Roscosmos Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) spacecraft and is capable of investigating the Martian environment at very high spectral resolution in the ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectral ranges by means of three separate channels: UVIS (0.2-0.65 μm), LNO (2.2-3.8 μm), and SO (2.3-4.3 μm). Among all channels, LNO is the only one operating at infrared wavelengths in nadir-viewing geometry, providing information on the whole atmospheric column and on the surface. Unfortunately, the LNO data are characterized by an overall low level of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting their contribution to the scientific objectives of the TGO mission. In this study, we assess the possibility of enhancing LNO nadir data SNR by applying the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), a well-known algorithm based on the Principal Components technique that has the advantage of providing transform eigenvalues ordered with increasing noise. We set up a benchmark process on an ensemble of synthetic spectra in order to optimize the algorithm specifically for LNO datasets. We verify that this optimization is limited by the presence of spectral artifacts introduced by the MNF itself, and the maximum achievable SNR is dependent on the scientific purpose of the analysis. MNF application study cases are provided to LNO data subsets in the ranges 2.627-2.648 μm and 2.335-2.353 μm (spectral orders 168 and 189, respectively) covering absorption features of gaseous H<SUB>2</SUB>O and CO and CO<SUB>2</SUB> ice, achieving a substantial enhancement in the quality of the observations, whose SNR increases up to a factor of 10. While such an enhancement is still not enough to enable the investigation of spectral features of faint trace gases (in any case featured in orders whose spectral calibration is not fully reliable, hence preventing the application of the MNF), interesting perspectives for improving retrieval of both atmospheric and surface features from LNO nadir data are implied.",

This results from persistent, strong zonal winds at the surface encountering the north-south mountain chain, producing strong orographic lift, and resulting GWs. Here, we consider GWs in the stratosphere and mesosphere above the Andes as observed by the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size instrument, the Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment on the AIM satellite, and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument onboard the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite. GW variability is considered in the context of the location of the stratospheric wintertime westerly jet and planetary wave (PW) amplitude and phase. The occurrence of GWs in the middle and upper atmosphere depends not only on tropospheric sources, like the Andes, but also on the background winds through which they propagate. Results suggest that the propagation of GWs into the mesosphere is well correlated with winds throughout the middle and upper stratosphere. PWs cause the westerly jet to move over the Andes, resulting in an increase in GW amplitude throughout the middle and upper stratosphere. The evolution and variability of GWs are tied closely to the phase of the PW-1 and are linked to PW-2 when the PW amplitudes are sufficiently large. GW amplitude, as observed by all three data sets, increases in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere when the trough of the PW-1 in the stratosphere is over the Andes.",

These estimates could be improved by including the uptake of odd hydrogen species (HO<SUB>x</SUB>) on water ice clouds, but the reported uptake coefficient of HO<SUB>2</SUB> is likely overestimated for atmospheric conditions. This leaves a fundamental problem in Mars' atmospheric chemistry unsolved. Here, using the GEM-Mars general circulation model, we explore a range of processes involving multiple phases (gas, adsorbed and solid) that may contribute to an alternative solution. First, we focus on hydrogen peroxide (H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>) and discuss its physical states on Mars and its chemical impact. We also conjecture its photolytic destruction in ices with model simulations and Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars observations. Then, we include in the model all relevant (for Mars) heterogeneous reactions, both on dust and water ice, recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry for terrestrial atmospheric studies. We find that only the uptake of HO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> on dust are efficient on Mars. Finally, we find that attenuation of sunlight by water ice clouds in the calculation of photolysis rates leads to increased O<SUB>3</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> abundances below the ice clouds. The combination of the proposed processes leads to O<SUB>3</SUB> increases without the need for strong uptake of HO<SUB>2</SUB> on ice, but it remains difficult to find a good agreement with O<SUB>3</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> observations on the global scale.

Requiring only maps of the evolving surface flux, our method is similar to that of Lionello et al., but we introduce two ways to correct the electric field at the lower boundary to mitigate spurious currents. We verify the accuracy of our procedures by comparing to a reference simulation, driven with known flows and electric fields. We then present a thermodynamic MHD calculation lasting one solar rotation driven by maps from the magnetic flux evolution model of Schrijver &amp; DeRosa. The dynamic, time-dependent nature of the model corona is illustrated by examining the evolution of the open flux boundaries and forward-modeled EUV emission, which evolve in response to surface flows and the emergence and cancellation flux. Although our main goal is to present the method, we briefly investigate the relevance of this evolution to properties of the slow solar wind, examining the mapping of dipped field lines to the topological signatures of the \"S-Web\" and comparing charge state ratios computed in the time-dependently driven run to a steady-state equivalent. Interestingly, we find that driving on its own does not significantly improve the charge state ratios, at least in this modest resolution run that injects minimal helicity. Still, many aspects of the time-dependently driven model cannot be captured with traditional steady-state methods, and such a technique may be particularly relevant for the next generation of solar wind and coronal mass ejection models.",

The instrument, called the Coronal Imaging Polarizer (CIP), consisted of a 16 MP CMOS detector, a linear polarizer housed within a piezoelectric rotation mount, and an f-5.6, 200 mm DSLR lens. Observations were successfully obtained, despite poor weather conditions, for five different exposure times (0.001 s, 0.01 s, 0.1 s, 1 s, and 3 s) at six different orientation angles of the linear polarizer (0<SUP>∘</SUP>, 30<SUP>∘</SUP>, 60<SUP>∘</SUP>, 90<SUP>∘</SUP>, 120<SUP>∘</SUP>, and 150<SUP>∘</SUP>). The images were manually aligned using the drift of background stars in the sky and images of different exposure times were combined using a simple signal-to-noise ratio cut. The polarization and brightness of the local sky were also estimated and the observations were subsequently corrected. The pB of the K-corona was determined using least-squares fitting and radiometric calibration was done relative to the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) K-Cor pB observations from the day of the eclipse. The pB data was then inverted to acquire the coronal electron density, n<SUB>e</SUB>, for an equatorial streamer and a polar coronal hole, which agreed very well with previous studies. The effect of changing the number of polarizer angles used to compute the pB is also discussed and it is found that the results vary by up to ≈13 % when using all six polarizer angles versus only a select of three angles.",

      "abstract": "The nonlinear evolution of Alfvén waves in the solar corona leads to the generation of Alfvénic turbulence. This description of the Alfvén waves involves parametric instabilities where the parent wave decays into slow mode waves giving rise to density fluctuations. These density fluctuations, in turn, play a crucial role in the modulation of the dynamic spectrum of type III radio bursts, which are observed at the fundamental of local plasma frequency and are sensitive to the local density. During observations of such radio bursts, fine structures are detected across different temporal ranges. In this study, we examine density fluctuations generated through the parametric decay instability (PDI) of Alfvén waves as a mechanism to generate striations in the dynamic spectrum of type III radio bursts using magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar corona. An Alfvén wave is injected into the quiet solar wind by perturbing the transverse magnetic field and velocity components, which subsequently undergo the PDI instability. The type III burst is modeled as a fast-moving radiation source that samples the background solar wind as it propagates to emit radio waves. We find the simulated dynamic spectrum to contain striations directly affected by the multiscale density fluctuations in the wind.",

Impact is the most significant driving force in the evolution of celestial bodies, and the impact craters provide crucial insights into the formation, evolution, and impact history of celestial bodies. In this paper, we present a detailed review of the characteristics of impact craters, impact crater remote sensing data, recognition algorithms, and applications related to impact craters. We first provide a detailed description of the geometric texture, illumination, and morphology characteristics observed in remote sensing data of craters. Then we summarize the remote sensing data and cataloging databases for the four terrestrial planets (i.e., the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and Venus), as well as the impact craters on Ceres. Subsequently, we study the advancement achieved in the traditional methods, machine learning methods, and deep learning methods applied to the classification, segmentation, and recognition of impact craters. Furthermore, based on the analysis results, we discuss the existing challenges in impact crater recognition and suggest some solutions. Finally, we explore the implementation of impact crater detection algorithms and provide a forward-looking perspective.",

      "abstract": "Surface geologic features form a detailed record of Venus' evolution. Venus displays a profusion of volcanic and tectonics features, including both familiar and exotic forms. One challenge to assessing the role of these features in Venus' evolution is that there are too few impact craters to permit age dates for specific features or regions. Similarly, without surface water, erosion is limited and cannot be used to evaluate age. These same observations indicate Venus has, on average, a very young surface (150-1000 Ma), with the most recent surface deformation and volcanism largely preserved on the surface except where covered by limited impact ejecta. In contrast, most geologic activity on Mars, the Moon, and Mercury occurred in the 1st billion years. Earth's geologic processes are almost all a result of plate tectonics. Venus' lacks such a network of connected, large scale plates, leaving the nature of Venus' dominant geodynamic process up for debate. In this review article, we describe Venus' key volcanic and tectonic features, models for their origin, and possible links to evolution. We also present current knowledge of the composition and thickness of the crust, lithospheric thickness, and heat flow given their critical role in shaping surface geology and interior evolution. Given Venus' hot lithosphere, abundant activity and potential analogues of continents, roll-back subduction, and microplates, it may provide insights into early Earth, prior to the onset of true plate tectonics. We explore similarities and differences between Venus and the Proterozoic or Archean Earth. Finally, we describe the future measurements needed to advance our understanding of volcanism, tectonism, and the evolution of Venus.",

      "abstract": "The sedimentary cycle, including the processes of erosion, transport, and lithification, is a key part of how planets evolve over time. Early images of Venus's vast volcanic plains, numerous volcanoes, and rugged tectonic regions led to the interpretation that Venus is a volcanic planet with little sediment cover and perhaps few processes for generating sedimentary rocks. However, in the years since the Magellan mission in the 1990s we have developed a better understanding of sedimentary process on Venus. Impact craters are the largest present-day source of sediments, with estimates from the current crater population suggesting an average sediment layer 8-63 cm in thickness if distributed globally. There is clear evidence of fine-grained material in volcanic summit regions that is likely produced through volcanism, and dune fields and yardangs indicate transport of sediments and erosion of rocks through wind. Landslides and fine-grained materials in highland tessera regions demonstrate erosive processes that move sediment downhill. It is clear that sediments are an important part of Venus's geology, and it is especially important to realize that they mantle features that may be of interest to future landed or low-altitude imaging missions. The sinks of sediments are less well known, as it has been difficult to identify sedimentary rocks with current data. Layering observed in Venera images and in Magellan images of some tessera regions, as well as calculated rock densities, suggest that sedimentary rocks are present on Venus. New data is needed to fully understand and quantify the present-day sedimentary cycle and establish with certainty whether sedimentary rock packages do, in fact, exist on Venus. These data sets will need to include higher-resolution optical and radar imaging, experimental and geochemical measurements to determine how chemical weathering and lithification can occur, and topography to better model mesospheric winds. Sediments and sedimentary rocks are critical to understanding how Venus works today, but are also extremely important for determining how Venus's climate has changed through time and whether it was once a habitable planet.",

      "abstract": "The Martian atmosphere and climate system will respond as the solar luminosity continues to increase over the next 5 billion years. The Mars surface will heat up to above the melting temperature of water ice, even without greenhouse warming. Water ice currently in the polar caps and ground ice will melt, potentially repopulating crater lakes or a very small ocean, with the abundance possibly enhanced due to diffusion outward of water currently locked in the crust. The CO2 currently adsorbed in the regolith and locked up in the polar ice cap will diffuse into the atmosphere, providing up to 50 mbar total; this would increase the temperature further (albeit only slightly) via greenhouse warming. There are two end-member scenarios of what the climate could look like: (i) Surface water could drive an atmospheric water cycle somewhat analogous to present-day Earth's; this would create a global clement climate conducive to the existence of widespread life. While Earth's climate could have a transition to be more Venus-like as the Sun heats up, Mars could become more Earth-like. (ii) The widespread presence of liquid water could cause H2O to hydrate surface/subsurface minerals (or allow H released from water to escape to space) and CO2 to form carbonates, leaving Mars to continue with a dry, lifeless environment. It's not possible to determine which of these end-members (or where in between) actually will occur – the water cycle under these conditions is too different from any well-constrained model to allow us to predict how robust it would be or how effective in producing the sustained physical and chemical weathering required to remove CO2 and H2O from the atmosphere. This changing climate reminds us that exoplanet evolution and habitability can be driven by endogenous processes associated with a terrestrial planet as well as by the ability of EUV and a stellar wind from the host star to strip away atmosphere.",

Our geologic understanding of these landforms is based largely on radar images from the Magellan mission, in which gross morphology and small-scale properties can be difficult to deconvolve. Here we use Magellan radar backscatter data for ridge slope surfaces in 22 highland areas to understand whether the tesserae can be subdivided in ways that differentiate surface property variations. Significant variations occur in the mean backscatter of ridge slopes, and we divide the tesserae into two groups with echoes lower (n = 15) or higher (n = 7) than an average tessera radar scattering behavior. While both few-kilometers-scale slopes and centimeter-scale roughness can modulate the radar returns, at least seven out of 15 tesserae with lower echoes are correlated with fine-grained impact crater ejecta deposits that smooth the surface. We propose that distal ejecta deposition plays a major role in creating the observed range of tessera radar properties and obscuring aspects of their original formation and in situ weathering. Our twofold classification system provides a new way of assessing the physical characteristics of tesserae from the Magellan data. Upcoming missions must consider both their original morphology and post-emplacement processes if we are to unlock the geologic record preserved in tesserae.",

      "abstract": "Photogeologic principles can be used to suggest possible sequences of events that result in the present planetary surface. The most common method of evaluating the absolute age of a planetary surface remotely is to count the number of impact craters that have occurred after the surface formed, with the assumption that the craters occur in a spatially random fashion over time. Using additional assumptions, craters that have been partially modified by later geologic activity can be used to assess the time frames for an interpreted sequence of events. The total number of craters on Venus is low and the spatial distribution taken by itself is nearly indistinguishable from random. The overall implication is that the Venusian surface is much closer to Earth in its youthfulness than the other, smaller inner solar system bodies. There are differing interpretations of the extent to which volcanism and tectonics have modified the craters and of the regional and global sequences of geologic events. Consequently, a spectrum of global resurfacing views has emerged. These range from a planet that has evolved to have limited current volcanism and tectonics concentrated in a few zones to a planet with Earth-like levels of activity occurring everywhere at similar rates but in different ways. Analyses of the geologic record have provided observations that are challenging to reconcile with either of the endmember views. The interpretation of a global evolution with time in the nature of geologic activity relies on assumptions that have been challenged, but there are other observations of areally extensive short-lived features such as canali that are challenging to reconcile with a view of different regions evolving independently. Future data, especially high-resolution imaging and topography, can provide the details to resolve some of the issues. These different global-evolution viewpoints must tie to assessments of present-day volcanic and tectonic activity levels that can be made with the data from upcoming missions.",

      "abstract": "On terrestrial bodies other than Earth, volcanism and magmatism are often related to impact craters. On Venus, RADAR observations of the surface have revealed two categories of craters: bright-floored and dark-floored craters, the latter being interpreted as partial filling of the crater by lava. On the Moon, volcanic deposits and evidence of pyroclastic activities are also frequently located within impact craters, especially within floor-fractured craters. These craters are characterized by uplifted, fractured floors resulting from underlying shallow magmatic intrusions. The elastic stress induced within the crust by a crater excavation indeed has two competitive effects. It induces a depressurization of the encasing elastic medium, which provides a driving pressure to the magma. This allows its ascent through the crust despite the magma's negative buoyancy and explains why the magma tends to erupt preferentially within impact craters (Michaut and Pinel, 2018). However, the state of stress below the unloading is such that the minimum compressive stress is vertical at the unloading axis, which tends to horizontalize the dyke intrusion, therefore favoring magma storage below a crater at the expense of eruption.We calculated the stress fields generated by surface unloadings of different radius on top of a semi-infinite half-space and use them in numerical mechanical models of magma ascent (Maccaferri et al, 2011) to evaluate the path followed by a dyke below a crater. We identify several types of behavior (ascent to the crater floor, horizontalization of the intrusion, storage at depth, ascent to the planet surface) depending on the physical properties of the magma and crust, as well as on the dyke and crater unloading characteristics. We draw a regime diagram for magma ascent below craters as a function of two characteristic dimensionless numbers depending on these different physical parameters.Our results show that magma ascent to the crater interior requires relatively small density contrasts between the crust and magma and rather small crustal thicknesses as opposed to dyke horizontalization that results from larger crust-magma density contrasts and crustal thicknesses. Furthermore, on the Moon, craters are considerably deeper than on Venus, leading to a larger dimensionless deviatoric stress below a crater of a given radius, favoring dyke horizontalization and storage. This well explains why the magma tends to store as horizontal intrusions below floor-fractured craters on the Moon while it tends to erupt on the floor of dark-floored craters on Venus.ACKNOWLEDGMENT: This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No. 101001689).",

      "abstract": "Many large volcanic channel systems are recognized at the surfaces of rocky bodies of the inner solar system. The more than 200 channels known for the Moon mainly have simple sinuous forms with widths of up to several kilometers and lengths of up to hundreds of kilometers, typically commencing at topographic depressions and extending downslope until they fade into associated volcanic units. The Rima Hadley system was a key target of the Apollo 15 mission and was confirmed as a product of volcanic processes related to the emplacement of lavas in the Palus Putredinis region of Mare Imbrium. The more than 200 channels known for Venus are in many cases morphologically similar to sinuous lunar rilles, but some systems are especially large and complex, with widths of up to tens of kilometers and lengths that can exceed 1,000 km. Such systems typically commence at structural features or in regions of disturbed terrain and possess anastomosing reaches associated with prominent streamlined uplands. In contrast, Venusian canali typically maintain sinuous forms with widths of only a few kilometers but remarkably can be characterized by lengths of thousands of kilometers. Some Venusian channels were involved in the emplacement of fluidized ejecta in the vicinities of impact craters whereas others may have formed in such environments as a result of later volcanic events. The 10 large volcanic channels that are recognized on Mercury have lengths no greater than ~161 km but can have widths of up to several tens of kilometers. These systems developed as conduits for voluminous lavas that extend across adjacent impact basins. Terrestrial komatiitic channels of Archean and Proterozoic ages can have sizes that are comparable to those of lunar rilles, and the formation of these systems is likely to have played an important role in the development of associated Ni-Cu-(PGE) ores. The outflow channels of Mars have widths of up to tens of kilometers and lengths of up to thousands of kilometers and are widely interpreted as aqueous systems formed by catastrophic discharges from aquifers, but the properties and geological associations of these features and numerous other large Martian channel systems are arguably well aligned with those expected of volcanic origins. Overall, large volcanic channels of the inner solar system are mainly ancient products of the emplacement of low-viscosity lava flows of mafic or ultramafic composition, involving eruptions that were characterized by extraordinarily high effusion rates and total lava volumes that in some cases are likely to have been as great as those that characterized some Large Igneous Provinces on Earth. The deeply rooted igneous plumbing systems most favorable to the development of large volcanic channels would have been especially common in the earlier history of the solar system, when the interior temperatures of rocky bodies were greater than today. The early development of large volcanic channel systems is likely typical of the geological histories of large rocky bodies in the universe.",

      "abstract": "In total, up to 1000 impact craters with diameters from a few to hundreds of kilometers have been discovered on Venus. This is much less than on other terrestrial planets and on the Moon. This is caused by a very dense atmosphere and volcanic processes on the surface of Venus. The surface of Venus is composed of basalts of various types. They are formed by volcanic lava flows hundreds of kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide. Such large sizes are explained by the very high temperature of the atmosphere, which slows down the processes of lava cooling. More than 1600 rather large volcanoes and more than 1 million small volcanoes have been found on the surface of Venus. Many of them are geologically young. This indicates recent, or even modern, volcanic activity on the planet. In the early stages of its geological history, Venus was provided with thermal energy from collisions during accretion from protoplanetary matter. At later stages, heat for volcanism was provided by energy from the decay of radioactive elements. Recent studies indicate the presence of nearly four dozen modern active volcanoes on Venus. In infrared images of the surface taken by spacecraft, hot \"spots\" were found, 400 K hotter than the surrounding areas on the surface of Venus. In just a few days, their brightness decreased significantly. This is typical of modern lava flows. That is, volcanoes on Venus continue to erupt at the present time. It is believed that volcanism on Venus is most likely realized in the form of small eruptions with volcanic cones of different heights.",

Elevated areas of very large sizes were registered on the surface of Venus – continents, plateaus, mountains, mountain ranges, valleys, depressions. Many craters with sizes of 35-150 km and a depth of up to 0.5 km were also found there. Even the largest craters on Venus are shallow, up to 700 m. Cracks with a long length – are much deeper. Up to a thousand meteorite craters have been found there. On radar images, their bottom is dark, with a smooth surface. The shafts of these craters and the emissions from them are bright due to strong scattering of the radar signal. Also found are Pancake domes, grids of rectangular tesserae, labyrinths of valleys, etc. Channel-shaped channels are attributed to lava deposits and their flows. Bedrock on the surface is believed to be of igneous origin. Thin layered rocks were also found there. Their formation is associated with the fall of volcanic ash and dust from meteorites from the planet's atmosphere. It is believed that the outpouring of basalt lava was repeated. At the moment, active internal processes have almost disappeared. The surface of Venus, in comparison with other planets, turned out to be more smoothed. Volcanic formations occupy most of the territory of Venus and are mainly large plains.",

      "abstract": "Venus moves around the Sun in an almost circular orbit. Due to the dense atmosphere, the first information about the appearance and properties of its surface was obtained only from observations in the radio range. Close-range studies were initiated with the help of a radio altimeter on the module during the descent of the \"Venus-8\" spacecraft, and continued with the use of orbital modules. The \"Pioneer-Venus\" equipment worked in altimeter and mapping modes. Based on these observations, a topographic map was constructed for more than 93% of the surface. In general, the surface of Venus turned out to be quite smooth. Numerous volcanic structures with a height difference of up to 3 km and lowlands were found in low-lying areas. Mountainous, or \"continental\" regions on Venus occupy only up to 8% of the surface. The highest point on the surface of Venus – is in the Maxwell Mountains with a height of 11.1 km. The lowest point on the surface – is Diana depression with a depth of 2.5 km. Large highlands, called \"continents\", are 5,000-10,000 km across and rise on 3-5 km above the surrounding lowlands. Frozen lava flows are observed around many craters with diameters from 3 to 130 km. Craters on Venus are very shallow. Radar studies were also carried out from the \"Venus-15, -16\" and \"Magellan\" orbital modules. The most complete information about the surface of Venus was obtained with the specialized apparatus \"Magellan\" during 4 years of observations. There are impact craters in various parts of the surface of Venus. On the panoramas at the landing sites of the \"Venus\" modules, it can be seen that there are thin layered rocks, the formation of which is associated with the deposition of volcanic ash and meteorite dust from the atmosphere.",

      "abstract": "Exploring and expanding our understanding of the planets (i.e., planetary science) encompasses a vast array of topics and disciplines. This dissertation concentrates on the surficial processes of and examination of terrestrial planets, primarily via the study of volcanism and impact cratering. The first project starts with an exploration of NIR remote sensing techniques as applied to Venus. This work found that NIR remote sensing at the clement conditions just beneath the cloud deck provide vastly improved imaging capability. This improved visibility is most notable for the tesserae, regions of Venus of great interest to the scientific community. Radar imagery and derived data products were then used to survey 21 mid-sized volcanoes on the surface of Venus. Similar to volcanoes at larger diameters, the mid-sized volcanoes of Venus are significantly flatter than those on other terrestrial bodies. Several of these volcanoes also show deformation that requires a negligibly thin lithosphere some time after the emplacement of the construct. The third project then evaluates the hazards involved with safely placing a lander on the Venusian tesserae and examines potential methods by which to detect and then avoid these hazards. Safely placing a suite of scientific instruments on tesserae is necessary to answer long-standing questions about Venus. Current technologies put relevant hazards at the edge of detection (i.e., zero fault tolerance) and can execute divert maneuvers of only a few tens of meters. Investment in hazard detection and avoidance technologies is necessary to bring safety margins to acceptable levels; data from future missions – while helpful – will be insufficient to select safe landing zones prior to launch. Oblique impact cratering is a ubiquitous event (approximately half of all impacts are at 45º or less). Our poor understanding of this process leaves a significant amount of information buried and waiting to be uncovered. Low-velocity oblique impact experiments were conducted at John's Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory Planetary Impact Lab to better understand the oblique impact process and prepare for high velocity experiments at similar impact angles. These experiments also sought to understand the effect of target tilt, which is currently necessary at existing experimental facilities in order to simulate changes in impact angle smaller than 15º . These experiments show that target tilt significantly amplifies oblique characteristics (e.g., aspect ratio, butterfly ejecta). The time-delayed and spatially offset transference of energy from the impactor to the target is important in determining the excavation process and final crater morphology and ejecta distribution.",

Here we provide a refined global sediment budget for Venus by mapping and quantifying the volume of sediment from impact craters observable in Magellan data using updated methodology. We improve on previous estimates of the volume of impact-generated sediment by mapping the impact deposits for all craters ≥11 km on Venus. We estimate the planet's total budget of impact sediment to be a minimum of 290,000 km<SUP>3</SUP>, which corresponds to a global layer of sediment 63 cm thick. If erosional processes have been active over the average surface age (500 Ma-1 Ga), the transportable fraction of this volume implies a sediment mobilization rate between 0.18 and 0.36 nm yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, comparable to the late Hesperian-Amazonian era of Mars. We requantify the volume of sediment held in recognized eolian features by (1) applying morphometric studies of planetary analogs to assess the volumes of observed Venusian dune and yardang fields and (2) estimating the volume of proposed microdune fields. We also identify a new yardang field near Mead crater. Globally, we find that &gt;100,000 km<SUP>3</SUP> of available sediment is not accounted for by eolian deposits, concurring that lithification, resurfacing, and fields of as yet unidentified eolian features are other potential sinks for sediment. However, locally, individual eolian fields contain more sediment than can be derived from nearby craters, indicating that these fields contain additional sediment from other sources.",

      "abstract": "We present the results of our studies of the rheological properties and ages on Alba Mons lava flows. Previous studies have shown that the rheology of lava flows, such as yield strength and viscosity, as well as external parameters affecting flow characteristics, such as effusion rate and eruption duration can be derived by remotely sensed dimension measurements. The calculations made in this study are based on images obtained from the Context Camera (CTX) on board of NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) as well as data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). Absolute model ages (AMAs) have been derived by performing crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) measurements on CTX images. The main objectives of this investigation are not only the calculation of the rheological properties and ages, but also the analysis of possible correlations between the rheologies, ages and distances of the flows to the volcano's center. A comparison of the rheological properties of the investigated lavas with those reported for flows on other planetary bodies was also performed. The aim of the study is a better insight into the history of one of the largest volcanoes in the Solar System. We provide new information about the formation and composition of the volcano's lava flows, whether they changed over time, and until when Alba Mons has been active. <P />In total, 29 lava flows close to the summit of Alba Mons were mapped and measured. The calculated yield strengths are 2.79 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> Pa on average, ranging from 4.00 × 10<SUP>2</SUP> Pa to 9.61 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> Pa. We found effusion rates between 46 m<SUP>3</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> and 1528 m<SUP>3</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> with an average effusion rate of 636 m<SUP>3</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The derived viscosity is on the order of 1.04 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> Pa s with values between 1.27 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> Pa s and 1.0 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> Pa s. The lavas have erupted over a period of 11 to 223 days, with an average eruption duration of 68 days. The rheological properties derived in this investigation are very similar to those of other volcanic regions on Mars, especially Elysium Mons and Elysium Planitia. However, they differ from calculated rheologies of previous studies of venusian lavas and lunar lava flows. Based on the derived yield strength and viscosity values, the composition of the lava flows can be inferred as basaltic/basaltic-andesitic, which is analog to terrestrial basaltic or andesitic a'a lava flows. Significant correlations between the rheological properties and the distance to Alba Mons' center have not been found. AMAs could be derived for 14 of the 29 lava flows investigated, because 15 lava flows have either reached the state of equilibration or have too few impact craters to derive reliable model ages. The AMAs range from 130 ± 40 Ma to 810 ± 60 Ma. The results indicate a late volcanic activity at Alba Mons. Correlations between the AMAs and distance to the volcano's center, as well as between the rheological properties and AMAs were not observed.",

Incorporating and building upon previous studies, we synthesized decades of numerical methodologies into one cohesive code that is designed in a modular and user-friendly way so that the community can easily test a range of different algorithms and assumptions when examining the behavior of projectiles in an atmosphere. The magnitude with which a planet's atmosphere filters incoming projectiles from striking the surface directly affects the potential primary crater population, which can provide insights into the age and evolution of its surface. Using AEM, we examine the effects of deceleration, mass loss, and fragmentation on a theoretical projectile population through the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars. Projectiles were modeled to span densities (2,700 - 7,800 kg/m3), diameters (1 m - 10 km), velocities (1 - 40 km/s), and angles of trajectory (15° - 90° relative to horizontal). Algorithms and parameters were optimized using known terrestrial impacts (Chicxulub and Meteor Crater) and observed meteor phenomena (Tunguska airburst and Chelyabinsk bolide). We confirm that atmospheric filtration of small projectiles is sensitive to atmospheric characteristics, and that variations in algorithms and assumptions produce reasonable results when applied correctly. Projectiles required to produce a crater &gt; 1 km have initial masses &gt; 106 kg for Mars, &gt; 108 kg for Earth, and &gt; 1010 kg for Venus.

Traditional techniques typically require features to be manually logged; however, recent advancements in machine learning algorithms have greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy of recognizing features, allowing extensive catalogs of impact craters to be collated (e.g., Robbins &amp; Hynek, 2012, Wang et al., 2020). With future missions planned to explore Venus in greater detail (i.e., VERITAS, DAVINCI, and EnVision), now is an excellent time to revisit digital elevation models (DEMs) collected by Magellan and enhance previous catalogs of the structures that comprise the surface of Venus. In this study, we use a convolutional neural network approach to produce new databases of craters and volcanoes for the surface of Venus. A training data set is created manually in QGIS using the Magellan DEM and evaluated to determine statistically significant characteristics. We follow the approach of Silburt et al. (2019), binning the Venus data into quads of 30° x 25° about the equator, and train the algorithm \"as we go\" to increase the volume of training data at each step.

      "abstract": "Tessera terrain on Venus is complexly deformed and stratigraphically older than the plains with a crater age 1 to 1.4x the global average of 0.5 – 1 Gy. As such, the Venus tesserae are likely our only record of the first 80% of the history of the planet. Determination of specific rock types in the tesserae will provide critical insights into an early period of Venus' history. Several observations demonstrate that the tesserae were formed during an extinct epoch. They were formed during a high strain rate and higher heat flow. The Venus Express data show that tesserae have a lower ~1μm emissivity than the plains, which indicate that the tesserae have a lower FeO content and this may have formed due to plate recycling on a planet with surface water. The tesserae have a range of morphologies indicating lateral accretion and assembly. In this talk, I will discuss our present understanding of this terrain as we look forward to three missions to Venus in the coming decade.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionSince 2015, the Japanese meteorological satellite Himawari-8 has been observing weather in the Asia-Pacific region every 10 minutes [1]. Scanning the full-disk Earth also covers space adjacent to the Earth, where celestial objects, such as the Moon, are occasionally included (Figure 1). Onboard Himawari-8 is an Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), whose high spatio-temporal resolution can provide over 900 lunar images with 23 km/pix or better.Furthermore, various AHI bands from visible to infrared wavelengths possibly provide multispectral information about planets. In particular, some of the nine infrared wavelength bands on AHI have not been used for observing the Moon by any other spaceborne telescopes. For example, within the AHI infrared coverage of 6-14 μm, the Diviner radiometer onboard Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has only three channels around 8 μm [2].Despite such potential, the AHI images have never been recognized as a useful dataset in planetary science. In order to demonstrate the possibility of utilization of AHI data, we investigate the lunar thermal environment with the AHI data. We develop the procedure to extract lunar multiband brightness temperatures. Then, we compare them with the Diviner measurements and numerical simulations, posing some constraints on lunar thermophysical conditions.Figure 1. Synthesized images of the Moon captured within AHI. MethodTo derive lunar brightness temperatures, we use the Himawari Standard Data (HSD) published by the Japanese Meteorological Agency. First, we extract lunar images from all HSDs taken by the end of November 2021. Next, we manually choose 248 lunar images in which more than a half part of the Moon is captured (Figure 2). Then, we calculate the lunar orientation with SPICE to obtain the lunar longitude and latitude of each HSD pixel. Finally, after estimating background noise, we convert the radiance value to brightness temperatures at all nine bands.To interpret the derived brightness temperatures, we employ a 1-D conductive model to simulate the temperature on the Moon. In this simulation, the material differences must be considered because the thermal inertia of the media influences the temperature prediction, particularly on the nightside. Thus, the calculation is conducted for both rock and regolith, using the Apollo data [3]. Moreover, surficial roughness is critical because of its effects on shadows, notably in the morning and evening. Thus, we incorporate the statistical model among incidence angle, emission angle, shadow ratio, and roughness parameterized by the RMS mean slope [4, 5].Figure 2. (a, b) Images of the half-Moon and almost-new Moon taken on 2018/12/28 08:20 and 2015/11/09 13:10 in UTC, respectively. Brightness temperaturesLunar brightness temperatures derived from HSD are consistent with those measured by Diviner. Due to the similarity between band 11 on AHI (8.40-8.78 μm) and channel 5 on Diviner (8.38-8.68 μm), we compare HSD with the Diviner Global Cumulative Product (GCP) [6]. Although HSD is saturated at local times from 8 to 16 hours due to its dynamic range, the brightness temperatures from HDS match those from Diviner GCP in the morning and evening. In addition, HSD at Tycho crater also agrees with Diviner GCP even in the nightside, indicating the reliability of AHI for planetary science.Multiband lunar images by AHI reveal differences in brightness temperature among wavelengths, so-called anisothermality. In the morning and evening, the brightness temperature differences among bands increase with the incident angle. Nightside temperature differences also exist in Tycho crater. These anisothermal features are consistent with the Diviner measurements and indicate the mixture of various temperatures even within a pixel of HSD. Lunar thermophysical conditionsThe anisothermality in the morning and evening is caused by the surface roughness of the Moon. Due to various slopes on millimetric to centimetric scales, the surface temperature on the Moon shows a wide-ranging distribution, increasing anisothermality with the incident angles. In addition, our radiance simulation with the RMS mean slope of 16-20 degrees is consistent with the observed values at incident angles lower than 70 degrees. These slope angles also match those at Apollo landing sites [7].On the other hand, the nightside anisothermality reflects rock abundance. Because of the high thermal inertia of rocks, the midnight temperature of rocks is expected to be higher than that of regolith by over 100 K. As a result, only a slight mixture of rock in regolith can make brightness temperatures higher than regolith (Figure 3). Our mixture model of rock and regolith estimates the rock abundances at the equator and Tycho crater are 0.18-0.48 and 6.1-10.3%, respectively. These estimates are also consistent with the Diviner constraints [8].Figure 3 Temporal temperature variations at the lunar equator after sunset. The black points are the HSD brightness temperatures at band 14. The black dashed and dotted lines show the rock and regolith temperatures in our simulation. The solid lines show rock-regolith mixture models with rock ratios of 0.2, 0.5, 2, 10, 25, and 50 %. ConclusionConsistencies between AHI and Diviner indicate that the quality of HSD is sufficiently high for planetary science. Despite the spatial resolution lower than Diviner, the unique wavelength coverages of AHI can provide new spaceborne infrared datasets. In addition, AHI sometimes captures other planets like Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Thus, HSD can be a valuable data source for calibrations and future planetary sciences.

      "abstract": "As Mars transitioned from an early Earth-like state to the cold desert planet it is today, it preserved a near pristine record of surface environments in a world without plate tectonics and complex life. The records of Mars' Earth-like surfaces have remained largely untouched for billions of years, allowing space exploration to provide critical insights about the early days of our own planet. Here, we first review what Mars has taught us about volcanic, tectonic and metamorphic processes in the absence of discrete plates, drawing comparisons with the terrestrial and venusian records. Then, we summarize advances in understanding its early surface environments, including impact cratering, hydrological, sedimentary and geochemical processes. Altogether, the martian record provides a picture of early environments that were similar to modern terrestrial ones in many respects, with sediment and geochemical cycling, hydrothermal systems capable of hosting life, but with the exception that topography, sediment and heat sources were provided by volcanoes and impact cratering rather than plate tectonics. Mars thus offers a lens through which one might catch a glimpse of Earth's infancy, provided exploration efforts continue to refine our understanding of the similarities between Earth and Mars as well as the specificities of each planet.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe detection of anomalous bright reflections beneath the Martian SPLD by MARSIS radar has sparked a vast debate on the characterization of the basal material. The source of the reflections has been interpreted by someone as an evidence of basal liquid salty water [1, 2], while by others as clay sediments or volcanic rocks [3, 4]. Though it has been demonstrated that clays cannot be the responsible of the strong reflections [5], it has not yet been well understood if the dielectric permittivity of the volcanic rocks can be so high as to cause the reflectivity seen by MARSIS. Furthermore, although there are in literature several attempts to demonstrate a correlation between the dielectric properties of volcanic rocks and their whole-rock compositions [6], these data can hardly be compared with each other, since every work employs different experimental setup and procedures. Therefore, a definitive dataset of the permittivity of such samples and planetary simulants does not yet exist, especially at the operating frequencies of planetary radar sounders ( 1 MHz - 1 GHz). The present work aims to be a first step towards a reliable dataset of electromagnetic measurements of volcanic rocks, investigating the relation between their geochemical and their electric and magnetic properties.Methodology Sample characterization We studied the granular samples of three different volcanic rocks that are plausibly representative of the overall surface compositions of the terrestrial planets [7]. In the following, the samples are named as: St. Augustine (2006), Etna (1991-1993) and Etna (Holocene). The St. Augustine (2006) sample is a lava rock coming from the 2006 eruption of the St. Augustine stratovolcano in Alaska [8]. Sample Etna (1991-1993) comes from the Piana del Trifoglietto lava field at SE of Etna summit craters generated by the eruption started on December 1991 and stopped on March 1993 [9]; the rock is characterized by a potassic geochemical signature. Sample Etna (Holocene) is a mugearite from Pizzi Deneri Formation and it comes from an ancient eruption (57000-15000 years ago), representing the more sodic volcanic activity [10]. In Fig. 1 and Tab. 1 are shown respectively the TAS diagram of the samples and their geochemical composition.The samples exhibit different grain densities: ρSt. Augustine(2006) = (2.736± 0.001) g/cm3, ρEtna(91-93)= (2.961 ± 0.001) g/cm3 and ρEtna(Holocene)= (2.787 ± 0.001) g/cm3.Table 1. Whole-rock compositions of the samples.Figure 1. Total Alkali vs. Silica diagram of the samples.Electromagnetic measurements and mixing formulas The electromagnetic measurements were carried out with a two port Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), employing a cage coaxial cell and using the experimental procedure and setup described in [11]. The complex permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ were estimated by using the Nicholson-Ross-Weir algorithm and the equations slightly modified in [12]:where Fg is a factor related to the geometry of the cell, Γ and Ψ are the reflection and transmission coefficients, le = 5 cm is the electrical length of the cell, c is the velocity of the light in a vacuum and ν is the frequency. The complex effective permittivity of the two phases granular rock-air was studied using Lichtenecker and Bruggeman mixing formulas:where εi and εeare respectively the permittivity of the environment (the solid grains) and inclusions (air) and f = 1- Φ is the volume fraction of the grainsin the sample, with Φ the porosity.Results and conclusions Measurements with the VNA were performed on the granular samples at room temperature, for percentage porosities ranging from 31% to 55%. The magnetic permeability µ is not reported because the three samples do not show a magnetic behavior (and then we can consider µ ≃ 1). Fig. 2 illustrates the complex dielectric permittivity as a function of frequency and at Φ = 0.36. Gray areas in the plots show values that are not reliable since at high frequencies the NRW algorithm diverges because of the cell resonances. Data have larger uncertainties at low frequencies due to VNA instrumental limits. The two Etna samples show a similar dielectric behavior, instead the St. Augustine sample has lower values of both real and imaginary part of permittivity. In the end, we fitted at 80 MHz the complex permittivity as a function of porosity using eqs. 3 and 4. In Tab. 1 we show the measurements at Φ = 0.36 and the values obtained with the mixing formulas at Φ = 0. The St. Augustine sample has the lower values of the solid complex permittivity, probably due to its lower iron abundances and higher abundances of SiO2, while the two Etna samples show a similar dielectric behavior. Further measurements will be required in the future in order to identify the relation between the electromagnetic properties and the geochemical compositions of volcanic rocks that can be accounted as good simulants of the surface and subsurface of terrestrial planets, such as Mars and Venus.Figure 2.

      "abstract": "Traces of volcanic deposits and evidence of magmatic intrusions are often found within complex impact craters (~10 to 100 km in radius) at the surface of terrestrial planets. Relying on these observations on the Moon as well as on mechanical models of magma ascent, Michaut and Pinel (2018) proposed that the surface unloading due to a crater could provide a driving pressure to the magma stalling at depth, allowing its ascent through the crust despite its negative buoyancy. This effect increases with the impact crater size. On Venus, RADAR observations of the surface from the MAGELLAN NASA mission suggests two categories of impact craters: bright-floored and dark-floored craters (Figure 1), dark-floored ones representing a third of the crater population (Herrick et al, 1997). Both categories are found in the high plateaus as well as in the low volcanic plains. Dark-floored craters are interpreted as craters having smooth floors, hence appearing dark on radar images, because of partial filling by lava after their formation (Sharpton, 1994). Bright-floored craters would therefore represent a non-modified stage for craters. Dark-floored craters indeed appear shallower than bright-floored ones in rim-to-floor depth measurements. Since the smooth surface is localized within the crater and is in general surrounded by a bright aureole, these observations suggest that the magma could indeed ascend through the crust because of the crater unloading. Here, we use mechanical models of magma ascent in the crust combined with quantitative observations on Venusian craters to constrain the magma buoyancy and crust density on Venus that have allowed magma to reach the crater interior. We focus our study on a selection of craters in two main high plateaus of Venus: Ishtar Terra and Aphrodite Terra. Indeed, emissivity observations point to a low-density crust in the tesserae of the high plateaus (Gilmore et al, 2017), therefore suggesting that the magma may be negatively buoyant within the crust in these particular regions. The filling thickness of dark-floored craters is estimated from the depth difference between bright and dark-floored craters. We calculate the stress and pressure fields generated by a surface unloading on top of a semi-infinite half-space in a cylindrical coordinate system using an analytical model ­­­or using COMSOL Multiphysics for a surface unloading on top of an elastic lithosphere of finite thickness. From analytical models of magma ascent at the axis of a crater, we calculate the most probable crust to magma density ratio as well as magma storage depth that would fit the observed filling thickness. Results point to a magma slightly denser than the crust. Since the stress field due to a surface unloading also tends to horizontalize magma flow at shallow depth, we also use 2D numerical models of magma ascent to study magma trajectory below the crater (Maccaferri et al, 2011) and to constrain the necessary ingredients for magma ascent up to the crater interior.

      "abstract": "Wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps are unique stress markers providing key information on the deformation history of terrestrial bodies. Wrinkle ridges (WR) exist in variable morphologies, such as curvilinear, broad arched, and superposed double ridges which reach tens to hundreds of kilometers in length. Some of these are discontinuous, bifurcating, or form en-echelon arrays. Lobate scarps (LS) are long, curvilinear, relatively steep thrust fault-related landforms. The presence of wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps on terrestrial planets has been documented in earlier studies on the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars. On Mars, the Tharsis rise is a large igneous province where compressional stresses form wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps in the periphery of its bulge. These concentric landforms are common within the flood basalts around the Tharsis rise. Constraining the formation time of these markers will yield a better insight in understanding the plume-induced deformation history of the Tharsis rise. In this study, we aim to understand the latest activation of plume-induced azimuthal compressive surface stresses. We use High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) (∼0.25 m/px) in addition to Context Camera (CTX) (∼6-7m/px) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). We performed crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) and Buffer Crater Counting (BCC) technique to measure absolute model ages (AMAs). Preliminary results indicate a unique example of an LS to WR transition in southwest Lunae Planum (LP). We observe thrust fault ruptures within the Amazonian platey flow material (Apf) (∼540 Ma) of Echus Chasma. AMAs for the hanging wall (HW) and footwall (FW) indicate that these structures are much younger than the geological units of Echus Chasma; i.e. ~ 110 Ma ± 50 to 310 ± 60 Ma. This result suggests a much younger age for the plume-induced azimuthal compressive surface stresses, which in earlier studies is assumed as 3.0 Ga to 3.56 ± 0.021 Ga. Therefore, while considering wrinkle ridge and/or lobate scarp ages to elucidate the lithospheric deformation and thermal evolution of Mars, caution should be taken due to late tectonic activities of these landforms.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: VERITAS is a newly selected Dis-covery class mission designed to understand Venus' evolution through acquiring foundational, high resolu-tion global datasets. A deep understanding of planetary habitability requires identifying key factors that govern the environment over time [1]. Venus is the ultimate control case for studying how Earth developed and maintained conditions suited to life [2]. Early Venus is very likely to have had essential habitability elements [1,3] such as surface water and even a dynamo. Tec-tonism and volcanism and possible outgassing driven by a robust internal energy budget very likely persist today. Our understanding of Venus' geodynamic evo-lution is severely hampered by limited resolution and quality of existing datasets. Mission Overview: Along with subsequent com-panion missions DAVINCI (NASA) and ENVISION (ESA), VERITAS kicks off the #DecadeofVenus with its launch in 2027. Data acquisition begins in 2029. The final orbit would be achieved in 2030, post aero-braking. The nominal science mission spans four Ve-nus rotation periods (~3 Earth yrs). Payload: VERITAS carries two instruments, the Venus Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (VISAR) and the Venus Emissivity Mapper (VEM), plus a gravity science investigation. The VISAR X-band [4] datasets include: 1) a global digital elevation model (DEM) with 250 m postings and 6 m height accuracy, 2) Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging at 30 m horizontal resolution globally, 3) SAR imaging at 15 m resolution for targeted areas, and 4) surface deformation from repeat pass interferometry (RPI) at 2 cm precision for targeted areas. VEM [5] covers &gt;80% of the surface in six NIR bands located within five atmospheric windows sensi-tive to iron content, plus eight atmospheric bands for calibration and water vapor measurements. VEM data will cover~80% of the surface to provide maps of global rock type and search for chemical evidence of recent volcanism and thermal evidence of active vol-canism, as well as near surface outgassing of water. VERITAS's low circular orbit (&lt; 250 km, mean 217 km) and Ka-band uplink and downlink to create a global gravity field with 3 mGal accuracy at 155 km resolution enables estimation of elastic thickness (a proxy for thermal gradient) and density differences due to subsurface processes. This field, along with use of radar tie points, also constrains interior structure, in-cluding mantle visocisty, core size and state [5]. Science Overview: Past and Present Water: VERITAS looks for the chemical fingerprint of past water in the tessera plateaus and larger inliers. Tessera plateaus may be analogous to Earth's continents, which form when basalt melts in the presence of water. VEM determines if tesserae are globally felsic or mafic, and thus analogous to continental crust or not [6-8]. Specific VEM bands are dedicated to detect near-surface water vapor [5] above background levels that indicate outgassing. Current Activity: VERITAS has multiple methods to search for activity, including 1) repeat pass interfer-ometry for cm-scale geologic deformation in targeted locations, 2) recent, chemically unweathered flows, 3) volcanic thermal emission, 4) topographic or surface roughness changes, 5) near-surface water vapor, and 6) comparisons to past mission data sets including Ma-gellan radar images and Venus Express NIR spectra. Geologic Evolution: VERITAS answers key science questions via determing: 1) the origin of possible con-tinent-like features, 2) the history of volcanism and how it has shaped Venus' young surface, 3) impact crater modification processes, 4) possible subduction zone activity and the processes governing their for-mation, 5) if there is evidence of buried tectonic or impact features and 6) links between interior convec-tion and surface geology. VERITAS would create a global inventory of geodynamic processes to under-stand the alternate evolutionary path of Earth's twin. Summary: VERITAS creates foundational data sets of high resolution topography, imaging, spectros-copy, and gravity. VERITAS answers outstanding fundamental questions such as whether catastrophic resurfacing occurred, what types of geologic processes are active, whether tessera record the chemical history of water, and core size and state.

      "abstract": "From the observations on ~1000 recognizable impact craters on Venus' surface, the average surface age for Venus is comparable to the average surface age for Earth, and is significantly younger than the surface ages of other solar terrestrial planets. To explain Venus' young surface without plate tectonics, the global tectonics of Venus have often been proposed to be in an episodic-lid regime with catastrophic global overturns. Previous episodic-lid geodynamic models often assume an olivine-diffusion-creep rheology for Venus' crust, resulting in global overturns followed by stagnant-lid phases with near-zero surface mobilities. However, some tectonic units on Venus' surfaces show substantial tectonic deformation, such as tesserae and coronae. Recent analyses of satellite images on Venus' surface also suggest possible widespread lithospheric mobilities in the lowland basins. And these observations can hardly be explained by the stagnant-lid phases between overturns in the episodic-lid models.In this study, we test the influence of (1) a composite, experiment-based crustal rheology (including diffusion creep, dislocation creep, and plasticity), and (2) intrusive magmatism, on Venus' surface tectonics, using the mantle convection code StagYY in a 2D spherical annulus geometry. Our results show that applying the experiment-based rheology and intrusive magmatism in the model results in (1) both global and regional overturns, (2) high and continuous surface mobilities that indicate substantial surface deformation between global overturns, and (3) a young and thinner crust that is consistent with current estimations. As for volcanic activities, contrary to olivine-diffusion-creep models, there is no persistent mantle plume in our models when the realistic crustal rheology is applied. The basalt cumulated between the upper and lower mantle affects convective flows in the mantle and mantle upwellings from the core-mantle boundary. Also, there are short-term, randomly located volcanisms within crust between global overturns, which are consistent with recent observations of active magmatism on Venus' surface and the short-term plumes suggested by coronae formation models. The surface tectonics in our models are dependent on the heat transfer efficiency in the upper mantle. And the tectonic regime is different from both episodic-lid regime and plutonic-squishy-lid regime that are proposed in previous literature, and can provide insights on the tectonic style for Venus and early Earth.",

      "abstract": "Our team has discovered first impact craters under the thick Venusian atmosphere with radar images during the Venera 15/16 mission. Later Magellan radar images of a better quality allowed us to count all impact craters and to find amazing features, splotches, resulted most probably from \"airbursts\" - total explosive disruption in flight of small celestial bodies. Splotches could have a central feature (possibly caused by terminal impacts of fragments), or could be diffusive patches of increased (bright) or decreased (dark) areas of changed radar reflectivity. The main explanation so far is that atmospheric shock waves, generated by airbursts, somehow change the surface radar reflectivity, e.g. creating smoother (radar dark) or more rough (radar bright) zones due to reflection of shocks. Size of splotches vary from ~10 km to ~200 km, being comparable with the characteristic atmosphere thickness. The exact mechanisms of air shock wave interaction with the surface is still under debates, but promises to help us better understand the presence of dust/sand/pebbles/boulders at the surface of Venus as well as to estimate mechanical properties of surface rocks. We start a small project to support the issue. The project includes the numerical modeling of atmospheric shock waves on Venus due to cratering impacts and due to airbursts. Our modeling is compared with results published in 1990s-2000s. Airbursts are modeled as a hot spheric volume gas explosion 10 to 40 km above the surface in the Venusian stratified atmosphere. In addition to trivial parameters like maximum pressure, dynamic pressure and the wind speed behind the shock front, necessary for the following analysis of a possible \"aeolian\" motion of surface's fines, we try to formulate a general picture of shock wave propagation in the atmosphere after an airburst. We find that the large-scale hot gas bubble from the source zone creates a n x 10 km plume (a kind of a classical \"mushroom\"), which effectively expands laterally at high altitudes, pushing forward an enhanced shock wave. This wave is looking like a gradual conversion of the main shock wave from a hemispheric one to a conic front, returning back to surface. The other trivial (but not discussed quantitatively) phenomenon is the seismic wave, created by an air shock, but finally overrun the atmospheric shock front. It means that the surface air shock front at large distances arrive after the seismic wave shakes the surface. We plan to investigates all these phenomena and compare models with observations. An interesting possibility seems to be satellite observation of rare meteoroid entry to the Venusian atmosphere, as it now available for terrestrial bolides.",

We combine Magellan and Arecibo radar data to characterize surface properties across Maxwell for orbital or landed investigations. Arecibo data reveal a region surrounding and west of the 90-km crater Cleopatra with lower radar echoes and circular polarization ratio despite increased surface reflectivity. Modeling of microwave emissivity shows that the surface undergoes step-like reflectivity shifts at ∼6056.2 km and ∼6,061 km radius, such that the changes in radar echo between these altitudes are not due solely to dielectric effects. We propose that fine-grained Cleopatra ejecta mantles much of Maxwell Montes, consistent with Venus distal crater ejecta patterns and the longevity of mantling debris in the highlands. Future orbital or landed studies must consider the thickness of ejecta, source material, and effects of shock or melting on ejecta mineralogy.",

Many attributes of this activity have analogs to volcanic landforms and processes found on other planetary bodies, and so provide the potential for greater insight into caldera collapse, lava lakes, and pit craters on the Moon, Mars, Venus, Io, and elsewhere. Observations of the Kīlauea eruption also demonstrate the need for caution when using the preserved morphology of planetary lava flows to estimate mass eruption rates and duration between eruptions. Further, lava flows from Leilani Estates entering the ocean produced copious volumes of volcanic haze \"laze\" (a dense hydrogen chloride mist), and may provide a new explanation for the elevated chlorine levels detected by gamma ray spectrometers in Mars orbit.",

Numerous lines of circumstantial evidence together suggest that the planet is volcanically active today. Although previous studies have calculated volcanic eruptive fluxes on the basis of the volumes of lava needed to bury craters of various diameters on Venus, no estimates of the frequency of volcanic eruptions on the planet yet exist. In this study, we analyzed records for eruptive events on Earth between 1 January 1980 and 21 January 2021 for which data on duration and eruption intensity were available, and classified those events by tectonic setting. We then extrapolated those results to Venus by a simple scaling factor. We estimate that as many as 120 discrete eruptions, from individual volcanic edifices and of any duration and intensity, may occur on Venus per Earth year. Further, within any given 60-day window—a nominal timeframe over which an aerial platform capable of detecting volcanic activity might operate in the middle Venus atmosphere—we expect about four new eruptions to begin, with that number rising to almost eight when both new events and those ending within 100 days of the main eruption are included, or to as many as 20 when considering activity that lasts for 1,000 days. Several complementary techniques exist with which to search for volcanic eruptions at Venus, either from orbit, within the atmosphere, or on the surface, that can be used to test the estimates we make here.",

      "abstract": "On Earth, geologists have many techniques available to determine the absolute ages of minerals, rocks, and unconsolidated deposits; but obtaining absolute ages requires actual samples of materials collected in controlled ways from known locations. To date, such samples exist only for a handful of locations on the lunar surface. For all other extraterrestrial surfaces, ages are constrained through geologic mapping and the Principles of Superposition, and combining models of impactor flux with observed impact crater size-frequency distributions (CSFDs). Unfortunately, many processes can affect observed CSFDs: both erosion and deposition can alter observed crater diameters; surface properties (such as composition) affect both the initial crater dimensions, and how those dimensions change with time. Thus, there are few absolute age constraints on volcanic products throughout the Solar System. Mercury's volcanoes were mostly active ~3.9-3.5 Ga. On Venus, the small number of impact craters gives an average surface age of ~700-800 Ma; there is evidence suggesting that Venus may still be volcanically active. Lunar volcanism is volumetrically dominated by the maria, and most of the maria were emplaced between ~4.0 and 3.6 Ga. Mars appears to have experienced near global volcanic activity until ~3.7 Ga; by 1.6 Ga, volcanism was focused in the Tharsis and Elysium regions. In the outer Solar System, Jupiter's innermost moon Io is volcanically active and uniquely displays no impact craters on its surface. In contrast, Ganymede and Callisto display some of the most heavily cratered surfaces in the Solar System.",

      "abstract": "Venus has a thick atmosphere that prevents all but the largest impactors from reaching the surface to make craters. Ablation heats impactors to tens of thousands of degreesand may totally vaporize the smallest impactors. Aerodynamic stresses fragment impactors in the upper atmosphere and cause many of them to explode below the cloud decks. Shockwaves from these explosions can pulverize surface rockscreating smooth, dark patches (called splotches) in radar images. Scientists have debated how these geologic scars may help reveal the history of volcanism on Venus. Some argued that the number, distribution, and allegedly pristine state of the splotches favors models with global resurfacing followed by a limited amount of localized volcanism. Others countered that radar images from Magellan were inadequate to study all the geologic processes that may create and destroy splotches. At the start of the decade of Venus, it is time to revisit these coupled impactor-atmosphere-surface processes. Here we adapt models of impactor airbursts to address three science questions raised by recent and future missions to Venus. In general, we numerically solve the differential equations [1,2] that describe mass loss from ablation, momentum loss from aerodynamic drag, and aerodynamic spreading of a fragmented impactor. We use Monte Carlo models to quantify the properties and timing of impactors [2] and volcanic resurfacing events [3]. First, we assess if new proposed models for the populations of impacting asteroids and comets [e.g., 4] can reproduce the observed number and distribution of splotches with or without global resurfacing. Second, we explore if ablating impactors are frequent enough to pose as lightning flashes during Akatsuki-like monitoring campaigns [5]. Third, we determine if impactors could produce infrasound waves comparable in timing and magnitude to those promoted for characterizing seismic activity on Venus [6]. Ultimately, myriad types of observations offer constraints on models of impactor airbursts, which in turn are key to many outstanding science questions about the evolution of Venus.

      "abstract": "Venus surface, as inferred from its cratering record, is consistent with a uniform age of 500-700 Myr with some studies indicating even younger ages. Further, lack of visible features such as accretional margins or subduction zones suggests that Earthlike tectonic activity is not occurring today. Nonetheless, there must be some mechanism for continued loss of heat from the interior. Some recent analyses (e.g., Gulcher et al., 2020; Byrne et al., 2021) suggest that at least localized crustal deformation has been present since the last resurfacing 700 Myr ago. In addition, Venus possesses many volcanic features, with some indications that lava flows of age &lt;2.5 Myr exist (Smrekar et al., 2010), and these may also transport heat from the interior. Detection of either fault slip or volcanism as currently occurring will provide critical inputs to models of Venus interior and evolution. NASAs VERITAS mission to Venus, scheduled for launch at the end of this decade, carries a fine-resolution synthetic aperture radar instrument that can be operated in a repeat-pass InSAR mode, resolving cm-level crustal deformation. We have proposed an experiment to search for diagnostic deformation of Venus surface using VERITAS. InSAR analysis requires a large volume of raw data, and a full global analysis is well beyond the system data downlink capability. Thus, targeting of potential deformation sites is a key part of the experiment. The satellite orbit repeats exactly every 243 days, so the 2.5 year nominal mission duration allows only 2-3 repeat observations of any site and little averaging to lower uncertainties. Hence the main limitation to the accuracy of the deformation measurements will be from variations in propagation through the dense atmosphere, dominated by changes in SO2 content. At present we can estimate these to be 1-2 cm over short (~1-10 km) spatial scales. Similar constraints on early Earth-observing InSAR systems found many examples of fault slip/creep and active volcanoes. This experiment, while not certain to find activity, nonetheless has the potential to return unique observations of any current surface change on Earths twin, and offers the first opportunity to measure cm-level crustal deformation beyond Earth.",

Space Sci., doi: 10.1016/j.pss.2011.07.008) &amp; a resulting stratigraphic sequence &amp; geologic history framework. How do these results inform us about the history of Venus &amp; outstanding questions that can be addressed by the upcoming trio of missions destined for Venus? The observable geological history was subdivided into 3 distinctive phases: Phase 1 (Fortunian Period) involved intense deformation/building of thicker crustal regions (tessera) followed by distributed deformed plains, mountain belts, &amp; regional interconnected groove belts. Phase 2 (Guineverian Period) involved global emplacement of mildly deformed volcanic plains, followed by wrinkle ridge formation. Phase 3 (Atlian Period) involved prominent rift zone formation &amp; lava flow fields unmodified by wrinkle ridges, often associated with large shield volcanoes &amp; some coronae. About 70% of Venus was resurfaced during the Fortunian/Guineverian &amp; ~16% during the Atlian; estimates of model absolute ages suggest that the Atlian was ~2X longer than the Guineverian, thus, characterized by significantly reduced rates of volcanism &amp; tectonism. These observations raise some fundamental questions for future missions: 1. Is there evidence for extensive fluvial/glacial &amp; pyroclastic activity? When, where &amp; how abundant?: This is of critical importance for determining the history of the present atmosphere &amp; links to the volatile content of eruptive magmas. 2. What constraints does the distribution/volume of different aged volcanic plains place on atmospheric origin &amp; evolution? 3. How do tessera patterns of deformation compare among different occurrences &amp; how do similarities/differences inform us about tessera origin (e.g., downwelling/lateral collision, upwelling, etc.)? 4. How much strain is represented by tessera deformation features? How does this vary in space and time? 5. What is the history of topography on Venus &amp; how does this inform us about Venus thermal &amp; geodynamic evolution?: When &amp; how did the current topography form &amp; what are the relative roles of Pratt/Airy isostacy? 6. What are criteria for recognizing tectonically modified impact craters in tessera? Can additional craters be recognized?",

      "abstract": "The magnitude with which a planets atmosphere filters incoming projectiles (asteroids and meteoroids) from striking the surface directly affects the potential primary crater population. On an airless body, a projectile of a certain mass and velocity could strike the surface to form a crater. Meanwhile, on a planetary body with an atmosphere, the same projectile would be subjected to filtering mechanisms. These mechanisms cause alterations in mass and velocity (ablation and drag), as well as fragmentation and separation (breakup and pancaking). The resulting crater, if the projectile and/or fragment(s) survive, would be different in form from the one on an airless body. This study aims to quantify the tradeoffs between the magnitude of a planets atmospheric filtering and the projectile characteristics (initial mass, velocity, and angle of trajectory) with the highest probability of surviving to strike the surface. The final crater diameter for an incoming projectile can represent a simple or complex crater, as well as the total area of a multi-floored crater. To account for micrometeoroids that do survive atmospheric travel but do not form a crater, the minimum potential crater diameter explored in this study is 100 m. The mechanical model is informed by models of both Earth and Venusian atmospheric effects. The validity of the model is tested against the theorized initial projectile characteristics from previously studied terrestrial craters (e.g. Barringer) as well as documented asteroids and airbursts (e.g. Chelyabinsk). The projectiles to survive filtering are determined by testing a diverse population of projectile characteristics while also noting the projectiles probability of occurrence from known asteroid populations. Projectile types with different densities include iron, stony-iron, stony, and chondritic; diameters range from 10 m 100 km; velocities range from 1 70 km/s; and angles of trajectory range from 5 90 relative to horizontal. Combined with our knowledge of crater size-frequency distributions and resurfacing histories, this model can provide further insights into the relationship between craters on a planets surface and the atmospheric evolution of projectiles.",

      "abstract": "Linea are elongated and topographically elevated features that are associated with abundant lineaments parallel to the topographic elongation. Lineae have also been termed fracture belts, densely lineated material, and groove belts. A major question related to these groove belts is their origin: 1) Are they of tectonic extensional origin?, 2) Do they represent the surface manifestation of dyke swarms? 3) Are they a combination of these origins? 4) Why do groove belts have elevated topography? Detailed mapping at a 1:500,000 scale (higher than most previous mapping) should provide new insights into addressing the above questions. We have selected Jokwa Linea Groove Belt for detailed mapping at a scale of 1:500,000. Jokwa Linea extends for 1700 km from within southeastern Stanton quadrangle, V-38 eastward into the adjacent Taussig quadrangle, V-39, centered at -17°N, 210°E Lat/Long). Our initial mapping (reported herein) is from a 620 km long segment of Jokwa Linea in SE Stanton Quadrangle (V-38). Multiple sets of lineaments are identified and shown in different colours. Our mapping includes identifying and distinguishing rift faulting and the characterization of corona and nova and corona-nova. Current investigations are focused on 1) distinguishing the radial and belt parallel features in more detail, 2) assessing their dyke-related versus purely tectonic origin (e.g., presence of pit craters, volcanic flow sources, small shields, etc.), 3) examining stratigraphic and morphological relations to the more regional components of the groove belts and 4) assessing the relationship of this central feature to coronae, novae and related features located in adjacent areas along the groove belt. Our preliminary mapping shows: 1) that the components of the groove belt here are composed of narrow graben-like structures; 2) that these graben show distinct radial orientations around the 'nova feature' in a pattern very similar to radiating dyke swarms around terrestrial LIP centres and around many edifices of volcanic origin on Venus ; and 3) that major parts of these radiating graben systems curve toward the strike of the broader groove belt and join this regional trend.",

Comments, questions, and pull requests are welcome. We strongly recommend that interested users get in touch with us before diving in: john.weaver.astro@gmail.com Aperpy is a front-to-back aperture photometry pipeline written in python aimed at deep space-based galaxy fields. It uses pythonic Source Extractor (SEP, Barbary et al. 2016) to detect sources in a noise-equalized (i.e. inverse variance weighted) detection image, resamples images to a common pixel scale, builds emperical PSFs from point sources and corresponding matching kernels, measures photometry in a number of apertures including Kron-like 'AUTO' ellipses, auto-selects the most suitable aperture for a given source size, flags stars and artifacts, prepares ready-to-use output catalogs, and even run EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008). A number of diagnostic figures are provided as output. Methodology was adapted mainly from Whitaker et al. 2011 and Labbe et al. 2003. Currently it is designed for use with JWST and HST data, although extensions are possible.

      "abstract": "The study of the lunar surface is a significant field in exploring the Moon. As a non-negligible geological process shaping the lunar surface, however, the mass movements on the Moon have not been deeply studied regarding all available datasets. In this paper, we report the results of the literature review and quantitative analysis of 965 articles retrieved from the Scopus, WoS, and Astrophysics Data System databases using keyword search terms between the years 1872 and 2022. The main findings show that the lunar mass movements are a lasting but recent prosperous research topic (since 2009). The top three influential journals in this area are Icarus, JGR, and P&amp;SS. Robinson, Lucchitta, and Carr are the most three productive authors. California Institute of Technology, Arizona State University, and Johns Hopkins University are active institutions leading the lunar mass movements research, and the related institutions are mainly located in the United States, Russia, and China. Articles are primarily published in journals specializing in the fields of astronomy and physics. The index analysis of citation indicates the growth of the academic impact of articles about the lunar mass movements. This article summarizes the datasets, methods, and relevant parameters of lunar mass movements to facilitate future research, as well as discussing the limitations and trends in the field. In addition, four unsolved issues are proposed, including: 1) the lack of a comprehensive global database that records all types of landslides incidents; 2) the need for definite classification indicators to quantify the classification criteria for lunar mass movements; 3) the absence of a mathematical model to explain the triggering mechanism of mass movements on the Moon; and 4) the lack of quantitative indexes to evaluate the modification effect of mass movements on the lunar surface morphology. With the support of big data, the combination of artificial intelligence and traditional GIS methods is expected to become the main approach for addressing these issues such a bibliometric analysis can inspire future researchers by exploring the overall characteristics of the published literature on lunar mass movements.",

In response to the Astro2020 Decadal, survey we collected 10+ years of institutional data across many ROSES calls. To improve the diversity of the scientific merit review panels, we have developed a Python-based routine to query NASA ADS API (via a third-party ADS package) and determine the expertise of potential NASA reviewers. Focusing on researchers at Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) and smaller research institutions (\"R2s\"), we query their names and affiliations. The resultant publication data is processed through a series of customizable filters (e.g. publication years, type, and journal names). Through the relevant paper metadata we extract the author's collection of abstracts and create a series of n-grams that can then be scrutinized to determine the astronomical expertise of the author for consideration by NASA program scientists. The code is made publicly available and has been also modified to run on other user-determined lists (e.g. NHFP, NPP Fellows).",

Indexing and curation of journal articles and preprints remains an ongoing priority, and the expansion provides us opportunities to improve content coverage, search, and discovery. In light of this, the ADS Docmatcher pipeline aims to match arXiv preprints to the peer-reviewed published version, and vice versa. The Docmatcher is both discipline agnostic and preprint agnostic, since it takes no assumptions on subject area expertise and can be used with various preprint repositories as we expand our content coverage (e.g. ESSOAr). Among several benefits, the Docmatcher will help us improve citations and metrics, and support open access discovery for users.",

This hands-on virtual tutorial was geared to new users of the resource to teach them how to use the ASCL, with a focus on finding software and information about software not only in this resource, but also by using Google and NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS). With computational methods so important to research, finding these methods is useful for examining (for transparency) and possibly reusing the software (for reproducibility or to enable new research). Metadata about software is useful for, for example, knowing how to cite software when it is used for research and studying trends in the computational landscape.

      "abstract": "Remote sensing data of comets 9P/Tempel 1 and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P hereafter) indicate the occurrence of water-ice-rich spots on the surface of cometary nuclei [1-5]. These spots are up to tens of metres in size and appear brighter and bluer than the average surface at visible wavelengths.In addition, the extensive observation campaign performed by the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS, [6]) and the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System (OSIRIS, [7]) during the Rosetta escort phase at 67P revealed a seasonal cycle of the nucleus colour. This is characterised by blueing of the surface while approaching perihelion followed by progressive reddening and restoral of the original colour along the outbound orbit. The temporal evolution of the colour has been interpreted in previous studies as the result of increasing exposure of water ice at smaller heliocentric distances [8, 9], however, an explanation of such seasonal cycle in the context of a quantitative cometary activity model was not yet been provided.Recently, in [10] we showed that the seasonal colour cycle observed on comet 67P is determined by the occurrence of the above-mentioned water-ice-rich spots (referred to as Blue Patches - BPs -, given their colour). This can be explained in the context of activity models [11, 12] of pebble-made cometary nuclei [13], i.e. in terms of nucleus surface erosion induced by H2O and CO2 ices sublimation, driving the cometary activity.According to the scenario proposed in [10] (Fig. 1), the presence of the BPs is due to the exposure of subsurface sub-metre-sized Water-ice-Enriched Blocks (WEBs) thanks to surface erosion triggered by CO2 sublimation ejecting decimetre-sized chunks [12]. The WEBs are composed of ice-rich pebbles (dust-to-ice mass ratio δ=2, [14]), embedded in a matrix of drier pebbles (δ&gt;&gt;5) forming most of the nucleus. Once exposed to illumination as BPs, the WEBs are eroded by water-ice sublimation ejecting sub-cm dust [11]. By means of dedicated spectral and thermophysical modelling, we match the nucleus colour temporal evolution measured by the VIRTIS Mapping channel in the 0.55-0.8 µm spectral range. In doing this, we take into account the competing effects of CO2- and H2O-driven erosion that expose and remove the BPs, respectively, and are seasonally modulated by the insolation conditions, primarily depending on the heliocentric distance.The new nucleus model proposed in [10], implying an uneven distribution of water ice in cometary nuclei, reconciles the compositional dishomogeneities observed on comets (the BPs) at macroscopic (up to tens of metres) scale, with a structurally homogeneous pebble-made nucleus at small (centimetre) scale, and with the processes determining the cometary activity at microscopic (sub-pebble) scales.Figure 1. 67P surface gets bluer approaching perihelion as a consequence of the progressive exposure to sunlight of subsurface WEBs (from Figure 4 in Ciarniello et al., 2022, Nature Astronomy, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-022-01625-y). The comet nucleus is made of two types of pebbles, both including refractories and CO2 ice, with different water ice content: pebbles with high content of H2O ice form the WEBs, while H2O-ice-poor pebbles represent the rest of the nucleus. CO2 ice is stable beneath the CO2 sublimation front at depths &gt;0.1 m [12]. Approaching perihelion, the CO2 ice sublimation rate increases, eroding the surface by chunk ejection and exposing the WEBs. Once exposed, WEBs lose CO2 and are observable as BPs. Water-ice sublimation erodes the BPs ejecting sub-cm dust from their surface and preventing the formation of a dry crust [11]. The BPs survive until their water-ice fraction is sublimated, producing the observed surface blueing. Please refer to ref. [10] for complete details.References[1] Sunshine, J. M. et al.

Digitization of the notebooks began in 2016, and was completed in 2019. As the notebooks were digitized, they were made available online through the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). At the same time, the digital scans were sent to the Smithsonian Transcription Center for full transcription by volunteers. While the full transcriptions will prove useful to researchers when completed, they do not provide a mechanism for linking the PHaEDRA notebooks back to their original source material: over 500,000 glass plate photographs identified by unique plate numbers. To remedy this, PHaEDRA team members are now working with volunteers on the Zooniverse platform to identify and transcribe the plate numbers found in the notebooks. This new component of Project PHaEDRA is called Star Notes and will eventually allow for deep linking between the notebooks and the digitized glass plates.

      "abstract": "DOIs, LIDs and LIDVIDs are three types of identifiers given to PDS4 data sets and products for reference and citation as well as to improve the searchability of data in the PDS archive and beyond. PDS assigns DOIs (Digital Object Identifier) to data bundles or collections for citation purposes. To do so, PDS collects metadata relevant to the citation (such as ORCIDs of authors, relevant publications, dates, subject keywords). When the data set is archived, a DOI is released. The DOI citation is beneficial because they are permanent, which ensures they can continue to be used for years to come. . Additionally, they including metadata many other citation types may leave out. DOIs are also often submitted to the ADS (Astrophysics Data System) because all PDS datasets are peer reviewed. All PDS datasets are reviewed before being published and will show up in ADSs refereed section, which makes the data set more valuable for the data provider. LIDVIDs (Logical Identifier Version Identifiers) and LIDs (Logical Identifiers) are PDS-specific unique identifiers that are assigned to individual data products, collections, and bundles. LIDVIDs and LIDs both enable referencing and increase the ease of finding data, but LIDVIDs also reference a particular version number. All PDS products have both a LID and a LIDVID, and they are used for different purposes: Searching by LIDVID will get a specific version of a product, whereas searching by LID will get the latest version. Both LIDs and LIDVIDs are created using a structure which ensures its unique name. The combined use of these identifiers has allowed the PDS archive to become easier to use for both data providers and data users.",

      "abstract": "This paper calibrates how metrics derivable from the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System can be used to estimate the future impact of astronomy research careers and thereby to inform decisions on resource allocation such as job hires and tenure decisions. Three metrics are used, citations of refereed papers, citations of all publications normalized by the numbers of co-authors, and citations of all first-author papers. Each is individually calibrated as an impact predictor in the book Kormendy (2020), \"Metrics of Research Impact in Astronomy\" (Astron Soc Pac Conference Series Monograph 8, San Francisco). How this is done is reviewed in the first half of this paper. Then, I show that averaging results from three metrics produces more accurate predictions. Average prediction machines are constructed for different cohorts of 1990-2007 PhDs and used to postdict 2017 impact from metrics measured 10, 12, and 15 years after the PhD. The time span over which prediction is made ranges from 0 years for 2007 PhDs to 17 years for 1990 PhDs using metrics measured 10 years after the PhD. Calibration is based on perceived 2017 impact as voted by 22 experienced astronomers for 510 faculty members at 17 highly-ranked university astronomy departments world-wide. Prediction machinery reproduces voted impact estimates with an RMS uncertainty of 1/8 of the dynamic range for people in the study sample. The aim of this work is to lend some of the rigor that is normally used in scientific research to the difficult and subjective job of judging people's careers.",

In preparation for a recent update, the scope of the library was revised and reexamined. The scope now includes social sciences and commensal SETI. Results were curated based on five SETI keyword searches: \"SETI\", \"technosignature\", \"Fermi Paradox,\" \"Drake Equation\", and \"extraterrestrial intelligence.\" These keywords returned 553 publications that merited inclusion in the bibliography that were not previously present. A curated library of false positive results is now concurrently maintained to facilitate their exclusion from future searches. A search query and workflow was developed to capture nearly all SETI-related papers indexed by ADS whil e minimizing false positives. These tools will enable efficient, consistent updates of the SETI library by future curators, and could be adopted for other bibliography projects as well.",

      "abstract": "Literature surveys in astronomy are greatly facilitated by both open-access preprint servers (ArXiv) and online tools like the Astrophysics Data System (ADS). However, the astrophysics literature often uses specialised jargon, sometimes using multiple identifiers for the same phenomena. For example, the terms SFR-M∗ correlation, Star Forming Sequence and Star Formation Main Sequence, all mean the same thing in the galaxy context, not to be confused with just Main Sequence which pertains to stellar evolution. This can often be challenging for young researchers to parse, and can cause even established astrophysicists to sometimes miss relevant references. Other issues include in-group bias towards referencing and citing literature in a paper, or papers sometimes getting overlooked due to the large volume of new literature.To help circumvent these issues and provide agnostic, context-aware searches for relevant literature, we present chaotic_neural, a public python package that trains a Doc2Vec model on abstracts from the ArXiv to enable finding relevant literature. The model works by using a neural network to transform abstracts into a high-dimensional vector space. An input vector is generated using an abstract or a set of keywords. Relevant literature can then be searched for by looking for papers that lie in the vicinity of the input vector. Since the computation happens in a vector space, the search can be further refined with linear algebra using keywords. This introduces the possibility of adding and subtracting keywords and/or papers from other keywords and/or papers. The model also provides utility beyond literature surveys, creating a discovery space for future analysis and hypothesis testing. The currently available model (available at https://github.com/kartheikiyer/chaotic_neural) is trained on a large galaxies dataset (https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph.GA), but can easily be adapted to other fields and datasets.",

      "abstract": "Radio astronomy commenced in earnest after World War II, with Australia keenly engaged through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. At this juncture, Australia's Commonwealth Solar Observatory expanded its portfolio from primarily studying solar phenomena to conducting stellar and extragalactic research. Subsequently, in the 1950s and 1960s, astronomy gradually became taught and researched in Australian universities. However, most scientific publications from this era of growth and discovery have no country of affiliation in their header information, making it hard to find the Australian astronomy articles from this period. In 2014, we used the then-new Astrophysics Data System (ADS) tool Bumblebee to overcome this challenge and track down the Australian-led astronomy papers published during the quarter of a century after World War II, from 1945 until the lunar landing in 1969. This required knowledge of the research centres and facilities operating at the time, which are briefly summarised herein. Based on citation counts—an objective, universally-used measure of scientific impact—we report on the Australian astronomy articles which had the biggest impact. We have identified the top-ten most-cited papers, and thus also their area of research, from five consecutive time-intervals across that blossoming quarter-century of astronomy. Moreover, we have invested a substantial amount of time researching and providing a small tribute to each of the 62 scientists involved, including several trail-blazing women. Furthermore, we provide an extensive list of references and point out many interesting historical connections and anecdotes.",

Here we summarize the status of our initial investigation into this potential to identify candidate astrophysics priorities for the 2021+ period, using commercially available AI trained on recommendations in the Astro2010 Decadal Survey. Specifically, we apply an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Natural Language Processing to reveal trends in published research that may indicate research priorities. Topic models for ~550,000 digital text abstracts taken from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) were created for the years 1997 -2010, which we assume was the major body of research underlying the Astro2010 recommended science priorities. We can calculate the growth or decline of 400 identified topic areas over this time period. As a training set, we assess how these topics are related (or not) to science priorities in Astro2010, as well as to the ~300 white papers solicited as part of that Survey. Our assumption is that the growth rate of papers published in a topic area is a good proxy measure for importance of an area of research to the community. There appears to be good, albeit not perfect, correspondence between our machine-learning technique and the recommendations for future high-priority research reported in Astro2010. Differences can also be identified between the apparent recommendations by our AI-based process and those within the solicited white papers. When our training process is complete, our process will be applied to ADS abstracts from 2006 - 2019, which we assume will be the major body of work to underlie national astrophysics science priorities for the period 2021+.",

      "abstract": "Centrifugal Nuclear Thermal Propulsion is a second-generation propulsion concept currently being researched to succeed traditional solid core nuclear thermal propulsion. Current efforts across the space industry are focusing on development of technologies for enabling manned flight to Mars and scientific missions to the outer planets. To enable these types of mission's direct injection trajectories are needed to decrease exposure to astronauts and scientific payloads to the harsh environment of space. Current efforts in nuclear thermal propulsion have shown great promise in higher specific impulses ∼900 s, but even these levels of specific impulse fall short for manned Mars missions with durations less than two years or direct injection to orbit of the outer ice giants Uranus and Neptune without the use of gravity assists. High performance nuclear thermal propulsion has been proposed using bubble through nuclear reactors to reach specific impulses as high as 1800 s, however significant challenges exist to prove the feasibility of such a system. One of the major challenges is the fluid mechanics within the core of the engine since little is known about uranium in the liquid phase. An experimental study has been conducted to better understand the fluid dynamics to better inform the thermodynamic and nucleonic models. Using the data from the experiment, high-fidelity simulations have been developed to predict the fluid dynamics of the uranium fuel. This information can then be further fed into thermodynamics models in development to predict core temperatures and system behaviour. The validated models show that small bubbles reach thermal equilibrium, and high centrifugal forces and surface tension assist in confining the molten uranium within the reactor core. Injector methods suggest feasible configurations to encourage bubble flow while minimizing backflow of the propellant, motivating further study of Centrifugal Nuclear Thermal Propulsion based systems.",

We show that the concept has the potential to directly and unambiguously detect cold oceans within Uranian satellites and provide strong constraints on the interior structure in the presence of warm or no oceans. As part of a geophysical payload, the concept could therefore have a key role in the detection of oceans within the Uranian satellites. The main limitation of the concept is coherence losses attributed to the extended source size of the UKR and dependence on the illumination geometry. These factors represent constraints on the tour design of a future Uranus mission in terms of flyby altitudes and encounter timing.",

      "abstract": "We present the next-generation Cold OBject RAdiometer (COBRA) concept, which is optimized for measurements at ice giants and their satellites at far infrared wavelengths. COBRA would address key scientific questions about ice giant radiative balance, ice giant atmospheric structure, and surface thermophysics of ice giant satellites. Its measurements would be an essential contribution to a Flagship mission to Uranus, identified as a high priority by the recent decadal survey. Specifically, COBRA would fulfill the following science objectives: • Determine the radiative balance of ice giants, • Characterize the thermal structure and understand the large-scale circulation in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere of ice giants, • Quantify thermal inertias and identify possible thermal anomalies on ice giant satellites. COBRA would use passive radiometry from an ice giant orbiter at wavelengths from 0.3 to &gt;200 µm to fulfill its science objectives. It would operate in a pushbroom scan mode, where channels with different band passes are oriented perpendicular to the direction of spacecraft motion. Atmospheric temperature profiling of an ice giant's upper troposphere and lower stratosphere would be enabled by measuring the collision-induced H<SUB>2</SUB>/He continuum absorption at 26 - 43 µm in nadir geometry. Temperature information would be supplemented by measurements of ortho- to para-hydrogen ratio, which is indicative of vertical motions, and of C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, which acts as a chemical tracer in the stratosphere. Determination of ice giant radiative balance would be enabled by measurements of thermal emission in the mid- and far IR (8 - &gt;200 µm) and reflected sunlight in the UV/vis./near-IR (0.3 - 5 µm) using broadband channels in nadir and off-nadir geometries that cover a wide range of emission and phase angles. Ice giant satellite science would be enabled by far IR measurements near the peak of the Planck function. Measurements at multiple wavelengths and multiple times of day would allow the derivation of thermal inertia, providing information on surface structure and porosity, and possibly reveal thermal anomalies if the moons are geologically active. The enabling key technology for COBRA is thermopile detector arrays, which provide high sensitivity at cold temperatures without requiring cooling. COBRA has strong heritage from MCS on MRO and Diviner on LRO, which use this technology. COBRA would have ~100x more pixels with ~2x higher sensitivity per pixel compared to MCS and Diviner but with an instrument mass of only ~4.5 kg. A prototype is being developed under the MaTISSE program and is expected to reach TRL 6 in 2024.",

Elliptical Uranian Relativity Orbiter is a preliminary mission concept investigating the possibility of dynamically measuring the planet's angular momentum by means of the Lense-Thirring effect affecting a putative Uranian orbiter. It is possible, at least in principle, to separate the relativistic precessions of the orbital inclination to the celestial equator and of the longitude of the ascending node of the spacecraft from its classical rates of the pericentre induced by the multipoles of the planet's gravity field by adopting an appropriate orbital configuration. For a wide and elliptical $2000\\times 100\\, 000\\, \\mathrm{km}$ orbit, the gravitomagnetic signatures amount to tens of milliarcseconds per year, while, for a suitable choice of the initial conditions, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the range-rate shift can reach the level of ≃ 1.5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> mm s<SUP>-1</SUP> in a single pericentre passage of a few hours. By lowering the apocentre height to $10\\, 000\\, \\mathrm{km}$, the Lense-Thirring precessions are enhanced to the level of hundreds of milliarcseconds per year. The uncertainties in the orientation of the planetary spin axis and in the inclination are major sources of systematic bias; it turns out that they should be determined with accuracies as good as ≃0.1-1 and ≃1-10 mas, respectively.",

It is of scientific interest because its morphology changed significantly between the Voyager 2 encounter in 1986 and subsequent Earth-based observations around 2007. It is also of practical interest because some Uranus mission concepts have the spacecraft pass through the inner flank of this ring. Recent reexaminations of the Voyager 2 images have revealed additional information about this ring that provide a more complete picture of the ring's radial brightness profile and phase function. These data reveal that this ring's brightness varies with phase angle in a manner similar to other tenuous rings, consistent with it being composed primarily of submillimeter-sized particles. The total cross section of particles within this ring can also be estimated from these data, but translating that number into the actual risk to a spacecraft flying through this region depends on a number of model-dependent parameters. Fortunately, comparisons with Saturn's G and D rings allows the ζ ring's particle number density to be compared with regions previously encountered by the Voyager and Cassini spacecraft. Finally, these data indicate that the observed changes in the ζ ring's structure between 1986 and 2007 are primarily due to a substantial increase in the amount of dust at distances between 38,000 and 40,000 km from Uranus' center.",

Their pioneering exploration by the Voyager 2 Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) and Plasma Wave Science (PWS) experiments revealed a variety of electromagnetic radio waves ranging from a few kHz to a few tens of MHz similar to -although more complex than- those of Saturn or the Earth. The asymmetric magnetosphere of Uranus is highly atypical with a large obliquity, magnetic tilt and fast rotation period, so that the magnetosphere undergoes perpetual geometric recon guration. Hereafter, we review the rich zoo of Uranian radio emissions, including the auroral Uranian Kilometric Radiation (UKR) between a few kHz and 1 MHz, the Uranian Electrostatic Discharges (UED) observed up to 40 MHz, and low frequency waves (continuum, plasma wave emissions) at a few kHz. We then emphasize the interest of re-exploring this atypical radio source and present a modern concept of a digital High Frequency Receiver (HFR) in the framework of a Radio and Plasma Wave (RPW) experiment to be proposed to any future NASA/ESA orbital mission toward Uranus. This HFR concept, updated from the heritage of Cassini/RPWS/HFR, STEREO/Waves, Bepi-Colombo/PWI/Sorbet or Solar Orbiter/RPW is aimed at providing a light, robust, low-consumption versatile instrument capable of goniopolarimetric (polarization and direction-finding capabilities) and waveform measurements from a few kHz to ~40MHz, devoted to the study of radio emissions, plasma waves and dust impacts.",

Uranus is historically the least studied destination for aerocapture, primarily attributed to the lack of an engineering-level atmosphere model until UranusGRAM was released by NASA in 2021. The present study is the first detailed end-to-end study of a Uranus aerocapture mission concept taking into account constraints arising from launch vehicle performance, interplanetary trajectory, aerocapture vehicle design, thermal protection system, and probe delivery. The mission concept uses a Falcon Heavy Expendable launcher and a high-energy, fast-arrival V<SUB>∞</SUB> Earth-Earth-Jupiter-Uranus (EEJU) gravity assist trajectory to deliver a 1400 kg orbiter and a 300 kg entry probe to Uranus. The aerocapture vehicle is a derivative of the Mars Science Laboratory entry system with extensive flight heritage, and uses the state-of-the-art HEEET thermal protection system. Compared to the current baseline UOP mission using conventional propulsive orbit insertion with a 13-year flight time and 5-year orbital mission at Uranus, the proposed 8-year aerocapture mission concept enables a 10-year orbital mission at Uranus within the budgetary and schedule constraints of a Flagship-class mission.",

      "abstract": "Aerocapture, the method of entering orbit via a single pass through the atmosphere of a planet, is an enhancing or enabling technology for a range of interplanetary missions. Compared to propulsive maneuvers, aerocapture can reduce cruise duration while decreasing the total mass expended for orbit insertion, thus leaving more time and mass for the primary science mission. Two mission classes in particular both benefit from aerocapture and are of high priority for the next decade of planetary science: exploration of the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, and low-cost small satellite platforms. However, despite its potential benefits, aerocapture has never been implemented in flight. This is primarily because of the large uncertainties involved, which must be modeled and adequately mitigated by closed-loop autonomous guidance onboard the spacecraft. Aerocapture guidance has been well-studied for vehicles that control their atmospheric flight by changing the orientation of a lift vector, but is not as well developed for a class of flight vehicles that achieve control by releasing a drag device mid-flight. Known as drag modulation, this control mechanism is significantly less complex in terms of hardware and avionics than lift modulation, and is thus appealing for small satellite missions. However, the state of the art guidance solutions have a computational demand that is both high and difficult to bound. This dissertation contributes a novel guidance algorithm for drag-modulated aerocapture that achieves equivalent performance to the state of the art, but with reduced computational demand. One of the most pernicious sources of uncertainty that aerocapture guidance must mitigate is atmospheric density, which varies over space and time. While scientific and engineering atmosphere models are available and well-characterized for on-the-ground studies, models that retain this fidelity while being significantly more compact and analytically tractable are desirable for onboard use. This dissertation develops reduced-dimensionality models of uncertain atmosphere for use onboard a spacecraft, derives a method for updating the model based on noisy measurements, and demonstrates the ability to accurately predict future state uncertainty resulting from these environmental dispersions without requiring the use of random sampling. These contributions have a range of potential applications, including incorporation into future stochastic guidance algorithms. Many of the mission concepts most relevant to aerocapture, such as the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, involve more than one flight vehicle. These missions benefit from the ability to deliver both spacecraft to their destination with minimal disruption to the overall concept of operations. While a number of missions have successfully executed multi-vehicle architectures in the past, this ``co-delivery'' method has not received dedicated systematic attention. This dissertation addresses the concept as a topic in its own right, investigating the ability to co-deliver an orbiter and probe from a single approach trajectory without the need for a divert maneuver. Co-delivery of an entire network of probes from a single, non-maneuvering mothership is also investigated. Finally, expressions for relative motion in the velocity frame are derived in order to provide a mathematical model that is more intuitive than the typical rotating orbit frame for highly-elliptical orbits, as are common for aerobraking, entry, and aerocapture. To illustrate the unifying motivation for this work, the contributions of this dissertation are applied to an example problem: the concept of reducing atmospheric uncertainty for aerocapture by including a fly-ahead probe that enters the atmosphere some time before the orbiter. While this idea has been proposed several times, the benefit conferred to the orbiter by the probe has not been quantified. The contributions of this dissertation naturally lend themselves to addressing this problem, as well as other entry, aerocapture, and co-delivery scenarios for future interplanetary missions.",

      "abstract": "We present the Shadow Chaser mission concept to perform stellar occultation (SO) measurements of Uranus and Neptune (U&amp;N) from Earth orbit to transform our understanding of the middle and upper atmospheres of these Ice Giants, the last class of planets to be explored by an orbiter. The latest Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey recommended a Flagship orbiter mission to Uranus to be launched in the early 2030s and a subsequent New Frontiers mission to the Neptune system; the Shadow Chaser concept aims to characterize the middle and upper atmospheres of U&amp;N to guide the design and operations of future missions to U&amp;N. Our development currently targets proposal submission to NASA's next SIMPLEx Announcement of Opportunity to start taking orbital measurements in the late 2020s. The key progress to be enabled by Shadow Chaser over Voyager 2 and ground-based SO measurements is the vastly improved data quality to be returned by our mission concept. The mission's main scientific objectives includes investigating the surprisingly hot thermospheres of U&amp;N found by Voyager 2 (V2). The highly uncertain V2 results remain controversial because they could be explained only by invoking an unknown heat source. Earth-based stellar occultation measurements sense altitudes between the upper stratosphere and lower thermosphere (approximately between 0.1 and 100 microbar levels). Our effort so far has determined the performance requirements for the Shadow Chaser concept, and shown that a &gt;20-cm telescope aperture in Earth orbit can measure SOs with less uncertainties than V2. We present potential design options that meet the performance requirements. Shadow Chaser will advance science, and also benefit future atmospheric entry missions to U&amp;N. In particular, improved measurements by Shadow Chaser will reduce the risk in an aerocapture orbit insertion maneuver, which is a technology that may enable new interplanetary trajectories and enhance future missions to U&amp;N.",

      "abstract": "We present the next-generation Cold OBject RAdiometer (COBRA) concept, which is optimized for measurements at ice giants and their satellites. COBRA would provide the measurements necessary to address key scientific questions for a Flagship mission to Uranus identified by the recent decadal survey. Specifically, COBRA would perform measurements that would reveal the: <P />atmospheric structure and dynamics of ice giants, <P />radiative balance of ice giants, <P />thermophysical properties of ice giant satellites. <P />COBRA would use passive radiometry from an ice giant orbiter at wavelengths from 0.3 to &gt;200 μm. Atmospheric temperature profiling of an ice giant's upper troposphere and lower stratosphere would be enabled by measuring the collision-induced H2/He continuum absorption in nadir geometry at far IR wavelengths between 26 and 43 μm. Global temperature measurements provide information on the circulation pattern in the atmosphere as horizontal temperature contrasts are an indirect measure of vertical motions. Temperature information would be supplemented by measurements of ortho- to para-hydrogen ratio, which is indicative of vertical motions, and of C2H2, which acts as a chemical tracer of vertical and lateral motions. Determination of ice giant radiative balance would be enabled by measurements of thermal emission in the far IR and reflected sunlight in the UV/vis./near-IR by broadband channels in nadir and off-nadir geometries that cover a wide range of emission and phase angles. Ice giant satellite science would be enabled by far IR measurements near the peak of the Planck function. Measurements at multiple wavelengths and multiple times of day would allow the derivation of thermal inertia, providing information on surface structure and porosity, and possibly reveal thermal anomalies if the moons are geologically active. <P />The enabling technology for COBRA is thermopile detector arrays, which provide high sensitivity at cold temperatures without requiring cooling. COBRA has strong heritage from MCS on MRO and Diviner on LRO which use this technology. COBRA would have ~100x more pixels and a sensitivity per pixel nearly two times higher than state-of-the-art, with an instrument mass of only ~4 kg. A prototype instrument is currently being developed under the MaTISSE program and is expected to reach TRL 6 in 2023.",

      "abstract": "Icy bodies are the most numerous and diverse bodies in the Solar System, but only a few have been visited yet by space probes. Some of these icy bodies, mostly giant planet satellites like Callisto, are called ocean worlds as they likely host most of the liquid water of our Solar System within sub-glacial oceans [Sotin &amp; Tobie 2004]. The presence of liquid water under the icy crusts of these bodies raises questions relative to exobiology. In the coming years and decades, these ocean worlds will be the focus of major planetary science missions, firstly with JUICE (ESA, launch scheduled in April 2023) and Europa Clipper (NASA, launch scheduled in October 2024) which will be targeting the Galilean moons, then with still conceptual missions as we speak such as (i) Uranus Orbiter and Probe and (ii) Enceladus Orbilander. Despite not being the prime target of any of these missions, Callisto will be investigated by JUICE and Europa Clipper through multiple flybys.One way to get information about Callisto's sub-glacial ocean is to look at the moon's surface, which may highlight markers of past or current activity and could lift the veil on its chemical composition. Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for such study, especially in the near-infrared domain where spectral signatures of H2O-ices, silicates, salts are detectable. Consequently, in preparation for future infrared spectroscopic data, and specifically those of the infrared imaging spectrometer MAJIS of the JUICE mission, a ground-based campaign was led with an instrument sharing some similar and also complementary characteristics: SINFONI (SINgle Faint Object Near-infrared Investigation), which was mounted on the UT4 of the VLT at ESO. Here we present the results derived from the analysis and the modeling of four full-disk observations acquired with this instrument.SINFONI combines an integral field spectrometer operating with different gratings with an adaptive optics module [Eisenhauer et al. 2003]. Our four observations were performed using the H+K grating, ranging from 1.46 µm to 2.41 µm, with a spectral resolution R = 1.500, but each spectrum acquired was automatically resampled in order to get a spectral sampling of 5 x 10-4 µm. The campaign took place from January 2015 from March 2016, and the observations were acquired near the opposition to optimize the angular resolution with Callisto's angular diameter close to 1.5 arcsec. As SINFONI's field of view is 0.8 x 0.8 arcsec2 divided into 64 x 64 pixels, one observation actually corresponds to a mosaic of ten overlapping acquisitions, as described in a paper about Ganymede using the exact same technique [Ligier et al. 2019]. All in all, after removing the high solar incident angle pixels we could not recover after applying photometric corrections (basically all pixels above latitude 60°, north and south), our dataset covers approximately 70% of Callisto's entire surface with a spectral and spatial sampling (~40 km/pix) which allow to detect and map the spectral absorptions that may exist in this wavelength range of the Callisto's spectrum. Spatial resolution is in par with that of the partial Callisto mosaic from the NIMS imaging spectrometer of the NASA Galileo probe.The first results obtained concerns the physical properties of the moon's surface directly derived from the reduction process and the photometric corrections; one obtains satisfactory results using the qualitative photometric model of Oren-Nayar, which is a generalization of the Lambertian model with the surface roughness (σ) as only additional parameter [Oren &amp; Nayar 1994]. In the case of our study, the best results were obtained with ranging between 17° and 19° whatever the observation. These values are much lower than the values in the 30° - 45° range provided by previous studies [Buratti 1991, Domingue &amp; Verbiscer 1997], however these values were obtained through the modeling of the solar phase curve via the Hapke model [Hapke 1984, Hapke 1986] using a combination of telescopic observations and Voyager data; the major differences between the approaches make the respective results hard to compare (our data are &lt; 10° emergence angle).Our second result concerns the global shape and spectral signatures in the surface spectra: overall, they are much flatter and more distorted than those of Europa and Ganymede, especially the quite large 2-µm H2O-ice band. To the exception of crystalline ice absorptions at ~1.50 µm, ~1.57 µm, ~1.65 µm and the 2-µm band, Callisto does not show other clear signatures (figure 1). However, very subtle signature(s), like the one at ~2.21 µm (figure 1), might actually be observed and are being investigated to confirm the detection(s). If confirmed it could suggest the presence of hydrated materials like salts or silicates. We will address this point during the meeting.Figure 1: Comparison between Ganymede's (blue) and Callisto's (red) mean spectrum of the entire dataset.And lastly our third main result comes from spectral modeling, where both linear and non-linear unmixing were performed. Unlike previous studies on Ganymede and Europa [Ligier et al. 2019, Ligier et al. 2016], the linear model shows that all of Callisto's spectra are satisfactorily modeled without needing any hydrated salt and that the only two constituents would be (i) a darkening agent, with abundances always exceeding 80% even for the iciest spectra, and (ii) multiple grain sizes of the crystalline form of H2O-ice, with an average abundance of 7% and exhibiting a strong latitudinal gradient for the smallest grains typical of the influence of the Jovian magnetospheric environment (figure 2). Such a low concentration overall of H2O-ice challenged us about the legitimacy of the linear unmixing approach, so we decided to run the Shkuratov non-linear unmixing model [Shkuratov et al. 1999]. Tests are ongoing but very preliminary results show that the overall concentration of the crystalline ice should be much higher than the 7% coming from the linear model and hence much more representative of what should be the surface composition of an icy satellite. By the time of the meeting, we will be able to present the final results of the study.Figure 2: Distribution of the smallest grains of crystalline ice.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric probes provide a critical method for understanding the Ice Giants, offering unique insight into atmospheric composition, structure, and dynamics. Such in situ measurements are vital to understanding the formation and evolution of these bodies and our solar system. To pursue these scientific opportunities space agencies are now turning their attention to the developmemnt of atmospheric probes to the Ice Giants and other bodies. The newly released Decadal Survey prioritized Uranus and Saturn probes as well as a Venus in situ explorer. Few such missions have flown and it is not likely that there will be other atmospheric entry probes until the DAVINCI+ Venus probe mission in the early 2030's. Entry probe concepts such as these require a delicate balance between science objectives, orbital mechanics, atmospheres, and signal processing. The development of future entry probe missions will rely on tools which allow mission teams to concurrently filter and compare trajectories to optimize science return.To aid science planning for future entry probe missions we have developed a tool for Visualization of the Impact of PRobe Entry (VIPRE) conditions on science, mission and spacecraft design. VIPRE provides concurrent design capabilities for entry probe and lander missions by combining a precomputed database of optimized interplanetary trajectories with analytical models for entry point targeting, atmospheric descent and data-return rates. The user is able to explore the science trade-space using a GUI to constrain a variety of entry, trajectory, and data sufficiency parameters. Constraint-based interaction allows for direct, easy evaluation of scientific value and mission feasibility in real time. VIPRE is flexible to a variety of mission architectures allowing direct comparison of mission value between combinations of orbiters, entry vehicles and landers.Users primarily interact with VIPRE through a GUI. Figure 1 provides an illustration of some of the available mission design, science parameter and constraint intereractions within the VIPRE GUI. On its left edge, the GUI allows for the selection of a target body, Saturn in this case, and a range of filtering parameters. Based on these inputs, the GUI displays the top row of plots which indicate the filtered interplanetary trajectory parameters. Once a trajectory of interest is selected the \"Overview\" parameters are populated and the bottom row plots are generated to illustrate reachable probe entry locations, colored based on parameters of interest. Reachability, in this case, is defined by the selected filtering parameters as well as target specific constraints, i.e. avoiding Saturn's rings. The GUI also allows for user definition of figures and filter parameters, shown in this example under the \"Globe\" and \"Side by Side\" tabs.This talk presents the motivation and models used for the development of VIPRE. Applications to Uranus and Saturn probe missions are discussed. Of particular interest is the accessibility of high and low latitudes for probe entry, how this is influenced by mission architecture (flyby versus orbiting probe release), and data constraints due to probe communications geometry.

      "abstract": "Radiation belts are found at Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which combined represent all of the sufficiently sized and magnetized planets in the Solar System. This fact is quite remarkable, since it implies that particle trapping and acceleration in magnetospheric systems is potentially a universal process in planetary magnetospheres and likely beyond to other astrophysical systems. Of these known radiation belt systems around the Sun, Jupiter reigns supreme. The Jovian magnetosphere traps - and presumably accelerates - relativistic ions up to multiple giga-electronvolts and relativistic electrons up to &gt;50 mega-electronvolts. Such high energy thresholds and intensities of trapped radiation render Jupiter more in line with astrophysical systems, like the magnetospheres of pulsars and brown dwarfs, where electron synchrotron emissions represent a significant loss process that can be observed remotely from Earth. For this and several other reasons, Jupiter is an ideal stepping stone for bridging the knowledge gaps between Earth, planetary magnetospheres in general, and astrophysical systems. Despite several missions having been dedicated to studying different aspects of the Jovian planetary system, no observatory has yet been fully dedicated or sufficiently instrumented to understanding why exactly Jupiter in many ways acts as the Solar System's greatest particle accelerator. Understanding i) which acceleration processes are unique to a system and why, ii) which processes are universal, and iii) how those processes scale with the properties of the system are the fundamental science drivers for COMPASS. COMPASS is a mission concept under development in advance of and for consideration during NASA's upcoming Heliophysics Decadal Survey. COMPASS is ideally instrumented for radiation belt physics, with a unique and unprecedented suite of instruments covering i) particle species from thermal plasma to 10s of MeV electrons and relativistic protons and heavy ions; ii) comprehensive magnetic and electric fields and waves; and iii) X-ray imaging. Combined, that suite will enable the COMPASS science team and greater scientific community to test existing hypotheses and make new discoveries of how Jupiter's radiation belts are sourced, accelerated, and lost within such a complex system. Jupiter's space environment is an ideal natural laboratory for enabling new discoveries and breakthrough progress on the topic of unique and universal radiation belt physics, particularly when put into context with results from previous Jovian missions (e.g., Juno, Galileo) and Van Allen Probes and other radiation belt missions at Earth. In this presentation, we introduce the science and conceptual design of COMPASS: a dedicated radiation belt mission to Jupiter with the primary goal of exploring the distinctive and universal acceleration, source, transport, and loss processes that drive the most intense radiation belts in the Solar System.",

      "abstract": "Exploring planetary atmospheres uncovers important information as to how our solar system formed and evolved. While remote sensing is extensively used, some crucial observations require in situ measurements by an atmospheric probe. Given their scientific importance, probe missions to Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are under consideration for the coming decades. In anticipation of future probe missions, the software tool Visualization of the Impact of PRobe Entry conditions on the science, mission and spacecraft design (VIPRE) was developed as proof-of-concept to facilitate selection of probe entry locations. Currently, there is no analytical way to identify which interplanetary trajectory from thousands of feasible launch opportunities is optimal for a considered mission concept. The search and decision process for that solution is complex and relies on the intuition of mission designers, who focus on a subset of trajectories to make the trade space manageable. The idea of VIPRE is (1) to generate a multidimensional data cube showing relevant engineering and science parameters simultaneously for thousands of trajectories, and (2) to visualize the data for all entry sites over the body's envelope. VIPRE lays a foundation to make available the data for browsing in a 3D visualization to identify the best family of solutions for a given mission. This paper introduces the validated and verified core algorithms of VIPRE, published on GitHub Probst. VIPRE serves as a basic framework to be used and extended for different purposes. The paper further presents the motivation for the development and algorithms; it explains the computation and data visualization strategy; and gives a list of suggested functionalities to extend and further develop VIPRE to fully leverage its potential.",

      "abstract": "Investigation of Uranus and Neptune, via orbiter and atmospheric probes, is required to answer pressing science questions that have been raised in previous Decadal Surveys. As the Ice Giants are the farthest planets from Earth, traditional fully-propulsive orbit insertion missions have transit times to the planetary bodies nearing 13-15 years and require a large amount of propellant, leaving less mass for the scientific payload (dry mass percentages of around 30-40%). Aerocapture uses aerodynamic forces generated by flight within a planetary atmosphere to decelerate and achieve orbit insertion. Although, aerocapture has not been used in the past, recent developments in thermal protection systems, guidance and control, and interplanetary navigation capabilities enable the use of rigid, heritage entry vehicle configurations already flown at other planetary bodies for Ice Giants aerocapture. With the addition of these recent capabilities, aerocapture can robustly deliver spacecraft to Ice Giant orbits, while substantially increasing on-orbit payload mass (more than 40%) and reducing the transit time by 2-5 years (15-30%) relative to fully-propulsive orbit insertion. Aerocapture is an atmospheric maneuver where the aerodynamic forces of the vehicle (lift and drag) are used to provide the V needed to slow down from the approach hyperbolic trajectory to achieve the desired captured orbit around the target planet. The aerodynamic orbit insertion maneuver provides a large savings in propulsion needed to change the velocity of the vehicle, since aerodynamic forces rather than propulsive systems provide the change in velocity. Aerocapture requires an integrated system level design, including thermal protection systems (TPS), actuator systems for aerodynamic modulation, and guidance and control systems that can autonomously command the change in the aeroassist forces. The benefits of aerocapture are destination dependent, but some of the largest mass savings occur for the Ice Giants planets. Due to the large hyperbolic velocities of interplanetary trajectories approaching Uranus and Neptune, large amount of propulsion (approaching 1000 m/s of V) must be used to put a spacecraft in science orbits around these planets. Aerocapture can reduce the propulsion needs by dissipating energy in the sizable atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune without a significant mass increase due to the need of an aeroshell. In fact, past studies commissioned by NASA has shown that the on-orbit mass can increase by approximately 40% using aerocapture versus fully-propulsive orbit insertion. This mass savings could be used to reduce the launch vehicle requirements or add additional science instrumentation. Since the vehicle will dip into the planetary atmosphere and will have a low initial periapsis altitude, aerocapture naturally allows mission designers to target science orbits with low periapsis altitudes, which are useful for ranging and remote sensing operations. Additionally, since aerocapture performance is relatively insensitive to increases in hyperbolic excess velocity, the interplanetary trajectory can be designed to arrive at the Ice Giants faster, reducing the interplanetary transit time and operations cost. Aerocapture could potentially help fit a larger class mission within a smaller cap, e.g. a Flagship-class orbiter mission in a New Frontiers class cap. Although aerocapture has been proposed for many situations in the past, including Mars, Venus, Titan, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune orbiters as well as for Earth demonstration missions, it has not been attempted on any missions. Aerocapture designs have been suggested since the early 1960s and have been reached the formulation phase, but missions have been cancelled due to non-technical reasons. NASA accepted aerocapture as the baseline mission mode for the proposed Mars 2001 Orbiter mission which matured to Phase B but was then cancelled in the wake of the Mars Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter failures in 1999 that were not related to aerocapture. Since then NASA has pursued a more conservative and heritage-based design for entry systems at Mars, thus limiting opportunities to demonstrate aerocapture. CNES also considered aerocapture for their Mars Sample Return mission plans of the early 2000s, but that project was also cancelled for non-technical reasons. Aerocapture risk has long been debated in the planetary science and entry communities, but studies have shown that the key capabilities for aerocapture for robotic missions are already feasible. In the past, uncertainty in aerocapture development came from two subsystems TPS design and guidance algorithms. With the development of Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) and Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA), and their advancement to TRL 6 and 9 respectively, NASA has TPS solutions for most planetary entry and aerocapture needs, and a minimum number of materials to sustain. Therefore, TPS for aerocapture applications is not a key technology risk. Similarly, entry guidance has matured. Mars Science Laboratory and Mars 2020 successfully used hypersonic guidance to precisely target the parachute deployment condition during entry, descent, and landing (EDL), a problem with more exacting constraints than planetary aerocapture. Hypersonic guidance and numerical predictor-corrector algorithms have been demonstrated during NASAs Exploration Flight Test 1. Additionally, Artemis-1, scheduled for a Lunar return flight test, will further bolster the confidence in similar guidance approaches. Even without a specific demonstration of aerocapture guidance, the performance of the advanced guidance schemes can be bounded by successful demonstration of similar and more stringent surrogate missions Aerocapture system will use the same proven tools and methodologies that have been applied to every successful NASA EDL mission. The models for the system design process and their efficiency have improved over the past 20 years. Designs consider vehicle or environmental uncertainties and add appropriate margins for to account for epistemic uncertainties. All the features of aerocapture, along with the expertise and technologies that have been developed over NASAs EDL missions in the last 20 years, give high confidence in the ability to successfully implement aerocapture for planetary science destinations, especially the Ice Giants, where aerocapture provides a tremendous advantage in on-orbit mass and transit time. This talk will discuss the merits of including aerocapture as an option for an Ice Giants mission. The discussion will focus on the cost and mass savings of using aerocapture instead of propulsive burns for Ice Giants orbiter mission scenarios while also detailing a potential concept of operations and entry vehicle design. Finally, the talk will discuss more recent work being done regarding aerocapture design that can improve science capabilities for an Ice Giants mission.",

      "abstract": "The Neptune Odyssey mission concept is a Flagship-class orbiter and atmospheric probe to the Neptune-Triton system. This bold mission of exploration would orbit an ice-giant planet to study the planet, its rings, small satellites, space environment, and the planet-sized moon Triton. Triton is a captured dwarf planet from the Kuiper Belt, twin of Pluto, and likely ocean world. Odyssey addresses Neptune system-level science, with equal priorities placed on Neptune, its rings, moons, space environment, and Triton. Between Uranus and Neptune, the latter is unique in providing simultaneous access to both an ice giant and a Kuiper Belt dwarf planet. The spacecraft-in a class equivalent to the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini spacecraft-would launch by 2031 on a Space Launch System or equivalent launch vehicle and utilize a Jupiter gravity assist for a 12 yr cruise to Neptune and a 4 yr prime orbital mission; alternatively a launch after 2031 would have a 16 yr direct-to-Neptune cruise phase. Our solution provides annual launch opportunities and allows for an easy upgrade to the shorter (12 yr) cruise. Odyssey would orbit Neptune retrograde (prograde with respect to Triton), using the moon's gravity to shape the orbital tour and allow coverage of Triton, Neptune, and the space environment. The atmospheric entry probe would descend in ~37 minutes to the 10 bar pressure level in Neptune's atmosphere just before Odyssey's orbit-insertion engine burn. Odyssey's mission would end by conducting a Cassini-like \"Grand Finale,\" passing inside the rings and ultimately taking a final great plunge into Neptune's atmosphere.",

      "abstract": "With the public and scientific community's growing interest in ocean worlds, the icy moons of Uranus offer an ideal opportunity to explore a native ice giant satellite system. Although it is uncertain whether any of the Uranian moons currently host subsurface oceans, there is tantalizing evidence-including geologically young surface features and volatiles that are not stable-that this could be the case, making these objects possible ocean worlds in their own right. Determining whether subsurface oceans are present in the interiors of these moons would increase our understanding of the conditions under which subsurface oceans are formed and maintained over the history of the solar system. The presence and stability of a subsurface ocean in the interiors of any icy body is key to identifying its potential as a habitable environment. In this work, we describe a midsize (New Frontiers class) mission concept: the Uranian Magnetosphere and Moons Investigator. The magnetosphere and moons are tightly coupled parts of the Uranian system, complementary to study, and best analyzed together in order to investigate the Uranian moons as potential ocean worlds. Additionally, this mission concept includes study of Uranus's unique rings and magnetosphere-solar wind interaction. With a future, more detailed trade study, there also could be opportunities for studies of Uranus itself.",

      "abstract": "We present a 6 DoF mission concept for in situ probing of Uranus' atmosphere, consisting of two un-propelled gliders and one orbiter in continuous line of sight. We focus on analysing the gliders' navigation and science modules. The post-processing relation between the vehicles' estimated states and measured scientific data is investigated. In situ probing by the gliders will allow measurement of spatially variable properties of Uranus' atmosphere over a flight duration of up to 25 Earth days, as compared to a few hours for a descent probe. I. IntroductionNo spacecraft has ever been to the Ice Giants to perform in situ measurements. The 2030s will offer this possibility, thanks to an alignment of planets allowing gravity assists by Venus and Jupiter, to reach Uranus with limited fuel consumption. This, combined with the illumination of Uranus' unobserved Northern hemisphere allows for unique science opportunities. In situ knowledge of an Ice Giant's atmosphere can provide information on the formation of the planet and on that of the Solar System. In particular, it could provide insight into why several models predict these planets' formation to have taken place much closer to the Sun than where they presently are [1]. The following research question will drive the study: How can knowledge about Uranus' current atmosphere help us understand the formation of the Ice Giants, and in a broader sense, that of the Solar System?This study investigates the feasibility of a mission with two gliders exploring Uranus' atmosphere. The focus is on the systems' navigation filter and on the post-processing relation between their estimated states and in situ scientific data. All chosen navigation sensors and scientific instruments related to navigation will be modelled in Matlab/SIMULINK and coupled with a 6 DoF flight dynamics model to estimate the gliders' states with sufficient accuracy. Scientific instruments are used as navigation sensors to tackle the ineffective use of optical sensors due to Uranus' high opacity atmosphere. The navigation module shall thus provide accurate information on the gliders' estimated states, and on any other knowledge needed to interpret the scientific data. II. Proposed MethodThe proposed mission architecture consists of two gliders flying in a straight symmetrical flight with tailwind, accompanied by a spacecraft orbiting Uranus. The science objectives can be divided into Tier 1, Tier 2A, and Tier 2B, in order of importance [2]. To fulfil them, Uranus' troposphere, which extends from 0.1 bar (≈ 50 km deep) to 100 bar (-375 km deep) [3], is targeted. Two target latitudes are selected: the equatorial domain at λ = 17.5°N and the polar domain at λ = 89°N. The gliders will fly at positive longitudes to explore both day and night sides of the Northern hemisphere.The mission's scientific payload is inspired by [2] with the addition of a NanoChem instrument [4], for a total payload mass of about 25 kg. A science traceability matrix (Table 1) shows how each instrument contributes towards the research question. The reference glider possesses ailerons, elevators, and a rudder. The aerodynamic coefficients were generated with Tornado [5] for minimum and maximum Mach numbers: M = 0.008 and M = 0.630. When flying at different angles of attack, the gliders' flight time can range from 2.36 Earth days at α = -6.5° to around 25 Earth days at α = -6°. The orbiter will perform a gravity assisted capture by Uranus and insert itself into a circular orbit, releasing each descent probe containing the gliders at the orbit's periapsis passages, making use of Uranus' fast rotation to reach the target latitudes and longitudes. III. Preliminary ResultsThe telecommunication between the gliders and the orbiter is inspired by [6]. Respecting a maximum aspect angle of 60° w.r.t. the gliders' zenith, a maximum range of 100,000 km, and considering a science data rate of 1,493 bps, around 18 min will be needed per glider to uplink its data to the orbiter, and 60 h for the orbiter to transmit that data to Earth. For maximum range, a minimum glide angle of 0.19° is found as well as a corresponding maximum arc distance of darc = 112,256.47 km. By having the gliders fly at respective latitudes of 89°N and 17.5°N, an orbiter at a minimum altitude of 26,487.5 km can continuously be in the gliders' telecommunication cones.The selected navigation module's sensors are: an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a Flush Air Data Sensor (FADS), and an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) transceiver. We model and implement an additional sensor, namely the Atmospheric Structure Instrument (ASI), as part of the mission's scientific instrument suite (Figure 1). It contains an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, and an ambient pressure sensor. Any instrument errors are neglected for now, but will be included in the final version of this study. For now, the drag coefficient CD is assumed to be determined correctly before flight, but will be changed when errors are added to obtain a more realistic flight value. In the final version of this study, the UHF will be modelled and related to the software, in order to conduct the Doppler wind experiment and navigation radio ranging. The post-processing relation between the gliders' estimated states and measured data will be presented, to yield accurate state estimations for trajectory tracking.

      "abstract": "In the pursuit of deciphering the formation of our solar system, the exploration of the compositional and dynamical structure of planetary atmospheres with entry probes plays a crucial role. A probe's measurements provide insight into an atmosphere's deeper composition and dynamical processes not accessible via remote sensing, providing key information on the origin and possible migration of planets during early formation phase. A planetary entry probe mission has been in discussion in several Planetary Science Decadal Surveys, one to Saturn has been identified as a mission of highest priority in the current one 2013-2022, and a mission to Uranus and/or Neptune carrying a probe is being considered as a Flagship mission in the next one spanning 2023-2032.In the development of such missions, the probe approach and delivery trajectory is a critical element to mission success, including ring avoidance, and targeting of highly desirable regions in the atmosphere, while balancing other requirements such as providing an optimal communication geometry between the probe and the relay spacecraft while meeting the mission's science objectives. Due to the complexity of the problem, mission concept studies are usually limited to the investigation of a limited number of specific trajectories and probe delivery opportunities to a very small, pre-defined range of latitudes while leaving a huge trade space unexplored.The tool VAPRE (Visualization of Atmospheric PRobe Entry conditions) has been developed to enable a fast and wide-range evaluation of entry conditions for planetary probes, spanning the complete range of latitudes for each of the three planets. VAPRE allows a rapid assessment of feasible entry sites by evaluating a large number of arrival trajectories based on their hyperbolic arrival velocities with respect to parameters such as the flight path angle and the relative entry velocity of the probe at the entry interface point. VAPRE facilitates the mission design process by combining the evaluation of technical feasibility and science value for the investigated scenarios to assess potential entry sites. VAPRE is developed in the framework of IPED (Impact of the Probe Entry zone on the trajectory and probe Design), which is a two- to three-year research study to investigate both the impact of interplanetary and approach trajectories on the feasible range of entry sites as well as on probe design, considering Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune as target bodies.In this paper we fully demonstrate the functionalities of the VAPRE tool on a case scenario for a mission to the Ice Giants.The presented research was supported by an appointment to the NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, administered by Universities Space Research Association (USRA) under contract with National Aeronautics and Space Association (NASA).",

These observations will provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the spectral evidence for past ocean world activity on these moons, assess the organic constituents on their surfaces, and measure carbon and hydrogen isotopes to assess the formation conditions in the Uranian subnebula. These science goals are highly challenging to investigate with ground-based facilities because of strong overprinting telluric bands over the 2.9 to 3.5 microns wavelength range. Furthermore, Earth's atmosphere is opaque between 4.2 and 4.5 microns, making detection and measurement of the 4.27-micron CO2 ice band on the Uranian moons and other planetary surfaces impossible to do using ground-based facilities. JWST is therefore the only existing facility that can make these observations. We require 9.96 hours of science time, and 20.72 hours of total charged time, to make the eight observations required to complete this project's science objectives. These observations will generate an important dataset that will inform the spectroscopic priorities of future spacecraft mission concepts that aim to explore Uranus and its moons.",

      "abstract": "Uranus presents a compelling scientific target and provides a unique opportunity to explore Ice Giant system science. The Ice Giants, Uranus and Neptune, represent a distinct class of planets with-in our solar system that has yet to be fully explored or understood. Characteristics of the Uranian system, in particular, include: 1) a dynamically full and haphazard ring-moon system; 2) five major satellites - potential ocean worlds with drastic surface features; 3) a dramatically configured magnetosphere with highly-tilted rotational and magnetic axes; 4) a bulk planetary com-position dominated by heavier \"ices\" such as H$ _{2}$O, CH$ _{4}$, and NH$ _{3}$; and 5) a unique wind pattern and unknown circulation structure. Detailed study of Uranus by an orbiter is crucial not only for valuable insights into the formation of our solar system but also for providing ground truths for the understanding of Ice Giant-sized exoplanets. As such, the imperative and timely exploration of Uranus will not only enhance our understanding of the Ice Giant planets but also extends to planetary dynamics throughout our solar system and beyond. The 2013 Planetary Science Decadal Survey Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 (V\\&amp;V) states: \"The ice giants are thus one of the great remaining unknowns in the solar system, the only class of planet that has never been explored in detail\". It also recommended \"Uranus Orbiter and Probe\" as the third-highest priority \"large-class\" mission. Unfortunately, no Ice Giant mission will be implemented before 2022, which makes it unclear whether a mission would make the 2030-2034 launch window necessary to take advantage of a Jupiter gravity assist to reach the Uranian system before it reaches equinox in 2049; after this the northern hemispheres of the satellites not imaged by Voyager 2 will begin to recede back into darkness. The timeliness of a mission to Uranus is thus a primary motivation for evaluating what science can be done with a lower-cost, potentially faster-turnaround mission, such as a New Frontiers (NF)-class orbiter to Uranus. This presentation summarizes one of three such proposals submitted to the 2019 Planetary Sciences Pre-Decadal Mission Concept Study (PMCS) opportunity. V\\&amp;V recommended in-situ measurements of noble gases and elemental isotopic ratios crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of Ice Giant planets. However, this paper presents the scientific basis for a mission which omits science objectives only achievable via in-situ measurements as descoping these may become necessary to launch a mission by 2034. Voyager 2's brief flyby encounter with Uranus provided a glimpse at the complexity and uniqueness of the planet and ultimately motivated more questions than answers. Our current limited understanding of Uranus is analogous to that of other planets prior to long-lived orbital missions (e.g., after the Pioneer and Voyager missions to Jupiter and Saturn). Just as our understanding of those planets was transformed beyond expectations by dedicated orbiter missions (e.g., Galileo, Juno, Cassini), so too will our knowledge of Uranus expand from the necessary multi-year measurements and investigation. Flybys only provide limited snapshots of a planetary space environment at a given location and time. It is challenging, if not impossible, to characterize a system with such a limited in situ dataset. The only way to comprehensively understand Uranus is with an orbiting mission. Orbital missions have flown to every planet in our solar system except for the Ice Giants. At each planet these first orbiters revealed many surprises that were missed during the initial flybys. For example, a major discovery of Cassini was the eruption of material from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, which was unnoticed by previous flybys. Future missions to Uranus will undoubtedly provide similar system-science surprises. A broad array of potential science objectives and outstanding mysteries covering all areas of the Uranus system (rings, satellites, magneto-sphere, atmosphere, and interior) could be addressed by such a mission. Though not explicitly defined here, a NF-class Uranus orbiter mission is expected to achieve many interdisciplinary science objectives. NF-class Design Considerations: Whereas a NF Uranus orbiter could be undertaken with current technologies, given appropriate trades in design, implementation, and scope, the mission would be significantly enhanced by future technologies. To achieve a meaningful NF-class Uranus orbiter mission, the mission design parameters must be assessed against completion of the science objectives, cost cap, and feasibility. In particular, studies that trade science scope and instrumentation/operational capabilities against simpler and cheaper options must be fundamental to the mission design. A high priority for a NF Uranus orbit-er should be to maintain a balance across research disciplines. A primary driver for the mission will be a total mission duration of no more than 14 years based on the flight design life of the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs). A typical baseline would be a two-year mission in orbit at Uranus with a system tour that enables surface mapping of the large satellites as well as spatial coverage of the planet and rings/small moons. Furthermore, the mission should be designed to complete its baseline mission by Uranus spring equinox (2049), enabling different illuminations of the satellites and seasonal orientation of the planet and magnetosphere than observed by Voyager 2. A significant driver of the mission design and subsequent design parameters is determination of the total mass that can be put into Uranus orbit within the NF cost cap. As such, the cost/risk-vs.-benefit of using aerocapture for orbit insertion should be considered. Because significant propellant mass is needed to put a spacecraft into orbit at Uranus ($\\sim$3 kg propellant per kg dry mass), mass efficiency is also critical to a mission's feasibility. A realistic $\\sim$60-kg payload (e.g. five instruments and radio science), would provide closure to several outstanding mysteries. Finally, power is perhaps the most limiting constraint on a Uranus orbiter mission and addressing power within cost is the primary obstacle to the feasibility of a NF Uranus orbiter mission. Previous Ice Giant mission studies have resulted in architectures requiring $&gt;$350 W-e end-of-life power, which requires six MMRTGs. Owing to the relative inefficiency and significant cost of MMRTGs, any design should attempt to reduce the needed end-of-life power; this will have significant impact on both the spacecraft and orbit design as well as the communication subsystem and payload. Other design considerations that place significant constraints on the feasibility of a NF Uranus orbiter include deep-space communications (specifically the power required for downlink) and radiation shielding mass.",

      "abstract": "This abstract will discuss the Cupid's Arrow mission concept, a small atmospheric probe that would sample Venus' atmosphere to measure the concentrations of noble gases and their isotopic ratios. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of geophysical evolution. They can provide information of processes driving atmospheric composition including original supply of volatiles from the solar nebula, delivery of volatiles by asteroids and comets, escape rate of planetary atmospheres, degassing of the interior, and the relative timing of these events in the planet's history. To date, planetary scientists have successfully made these measurements at Earth, Mars, Jupiter and a comet. However, our understanding of Venus' evolution given the elementary and isotopic pattern of noble gases and stable isotopes in its atmosphere, is today poorly known. Specifically, the concentrations of heavy noble gases (Kr, Xe) and their isotopes are mostly unknown, and our knowledge of light noble gases (He, Ne, Ar) is incomplete and imprecise. Cupid's Arrow addresses the Planetary Decadal Survey Goals for Venus, specifically, objective 1A, \"How did the atmosphere of Venus form and evolve.\" Noble gases cannot be sensed remotely, and instead have to be measured in-situ. The Cupids Arrow concept is a small, highly integrated atmospheric probe that could be targeted to fly through the upper atmosphere, collect samples at an altitude below the homopause, then analyze them with a new miniaturized quadrapole ion trap mass spectrometer and transmit the results back to Earth. In this region, atmospheric gases are well-mixed, and samples are representative of their naturally occurring concentrations. The development of this concept has made considerable progress over the past couple of years. A number of technical challenges, including hypervelocity sample fractionation and the compact size of the probe have been addressed using novel techniques. Cupids Arrow will result in a new class of low cost planetary probes for studying other atmospheres such as Titan or Uranus.

      "abstract": "The in-situ magnetospheric exploration of the four large planets of our solar system had started with Pioneer 10's flyby of Jupiter in Dec. 1973. The second collection of field, particle and radio data of the gas giant was carried out by Pioneer 11 in Dec. 1974, before this spacecraft made its closest approach to Saturn in Sep. 1979. Around the same period, Voyager 1 (2) flew by Jupiter in Mar. (Jul.) 1979 then Saturn in Nov. (Aug.) 1980 (1981). As of today, only Voyager 2 visited the magnetospheres of Uranus (Jan. 1989) and Neptune (Aug. 1989). Galileo had remained the only spacecraft to orbit an outer planet for several years (1995 - 2003) until the arrival of Juno at Jupiter in 2016. Between 2004 and 2017, the Cassini mission had provided a wealth of in-situ data pertinent to the study of magnetospheric particles at Saturn. In this paper, we present our current understanding of the processes that shape the spatial distributions of energetic electrons trapped in the magnetospheres of Jupiter (L &lt; 6), Saturn (L &lt; 15) and Uranus (L &lt; 15) obtained by combining multi-instrument analyses of data from past missions (Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, Cassini) and computational models of charged particle fluxes. To determine what controls the energy and spatial distributions throughout the different magnetospheres, we compute the time evolution of particle distributions with the help of a diffusion theory particle transport code that solves the governing 3-D Fokker-Planck equation. Particle, field and wave datasets are either used to provide model constraints, assist in modeling physical processes, or validate our simulation results. We will emphasize our latest results regarding the relative (or coupled) role of mechanisms at Saturn, including the radial transport and interactions of electrons with Saturn's dust/neutral/plasma environments and waves, as well as particle sources from high-latitudes, interchange injections, and outer magnetospheric region. The lessons learned from our modeling of electron distributions at Saturn will be used to identify the processes that may be missing in our modeling of Jupiter's energetic electron environment or those in need to be implemented using new modeling concepts. Our first physics-based modeling of electron populations at Uranus will also be assessed with our data-model comparison approach.",

      "abstract": "More than 30 years have passed since the Voyager 2 flybys of Uranus and Neptune. This paper outlines a range of lessons learned from Voyager, broadly grouped into `process, planning and people.' In terms of process, we must be open to new concepts, whether new instrument technologies, new propulsion systems or operational modes. Examples from recent decades that could open new vistas in the exploration of the deep outer Solar System include the Cassini Resource Exchange and the `sleep' mode from the New Horizons mission. Planning is crucial: mission gaps that last over three decades leave much scope for evolution both in mission development and in the targets themselves. The science is covered in other papers in this issue, but this paper addresses the structure of the US Planetary Decadal Surveys, with a specific urging to move from a `destination-based' organization to a structure based on fundamental science. Coordination of distinct and divergent international planning timelines brings both challenges and opportunity. Complexity in the funding and political processes is amplified when multiple structures must be navigated; but the science is enriched by the diversity of international perspectives, as were represented at the Ice Giant discussion meeting that motivated this review. Finally, the paper turns to people: with generational-length gaps between missions, continuity in knowledge and skills requires careful attention to people. Lessons for the next generation of voyagers include: how to lead and inspire; how to develop the perspective to see their missions through decades-long development phases; and cultivation of strategic thinking, altruism and above all, patience. <P />This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Future exploration of ice giant systems'.",

      "abstract": "The NASA Ice Giants Pre-Decadal Survey Mission Report (2017) recommended the high scientific importance of sending a mission with an orbiter and a probe to one of the Ice Giants, with preferential launch dates in the 2029-2034 timeframe. Such a mission concept is equally well supported by European scientists and Mousis et al (P&amp;SS, 155, 12, 2018) give compelling scientific rationales for the exploration of these worlds with missions carrying in situ probes.In this presentation we will outline the conceptual design of the Advanced Ice Giants Net Flux Radiometer (IG-NFR) instrument, currently being designed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to make in situ observations of the upward and downward fluxes of solar and thermal radiation in the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune. The IG-NFR is designed to: (i) accommodate seven filter bandpass channels in the spectral range 0.25-300 µm (ii) measure up and down radiation flux in a clear unobstructed 10° FOV for each channel; (iii) use thermopile detectors that can measure a change of flux of at least 0.5 W/m2 per decade of pressure; (iv) view five distinct view angles (±80°, ±45°, and 0°); (v) predict the detector response with changing temperature environment; (vi) use application-specific integrated circuit technology for the thermopile detector readout; (vii) be able to integrate radiance for 2s or longer, and (vii) sample each view angle including calibration targets. The IG-NFR system noise equivalent power at 298 K is 73 pW in a 1 Hz electrical bandwidth.We present initial simulations of the anticipated observations using two radiative transfer and retrieval tools, NEMESIS (Irwin et al., JQSRT, 109, 1136, 2008) and the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG, Villanueva et al., 2017, https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov). For the NEMESIS modelling the radiative fluxes observable at varying pressure levels were calculated with a Matrix-Operator plane-parallel multiple-scattering model, using between 5 and 21 zenith angle quadrature points and up to 38 Fourier components for the azimuth decomposition. We also employed PSG to further validate our flux estimates, providing an important benchmarking and comparison test between both models. PSG solves the scattering radiative transfer employing the discrete ordinates method, with the scattering phase function described in terms of an expansion in terms of Legendre Polynomials. Molecular cross-sections are solved via the correlated-k method employing the latest HITRAN database (Gordon et al., 2017), which are completed with the latest collision-induced-absorption (CIA, Karman et al., 2019), and UV/optical cross-sections from the MPI database (Keller-Rudek et al., 2013). For the nominal case the Sun was assumed to be at an altitude of 10° above the horizon. The internal radiance field was calculated at each internal level for a standard reference Uranus atmosphere (e.g., Irwin et al., 2017) with the addition of a single cloud layer, based at 3 bar and composed of particles with a mean radius of 1.0 µm (and size variance 0.1) and assumed complex refractive index of 1.4 + 0.001i at all wavelengths. The opacity and fractional scale height of this cloud were fitted in both models to match the combined near-infrared observations of HST/WFC3, IRTF/SpeX and VLT/SINFONI analyzed by Irwin et al. (2017). The internal radiance fields were calculated from 0.4 to 300 µm using this atmospheric model.We will show how these simulations are being used to guide the choice of spectral filter bandwidths and centres to optimize the scientific return of such an instrument. We will show that observations with such an instrument can be used to constrain effectively the radiation energy budget in the atmospheres of the Ice Giants and can also be used to determine the pressures of cloud and haze layers and broadly constrain particle size. Such modelling also allows us to simulate the visible appearance of Uranus\" atmosphere during a descent and to perform detailed validations of the simulations by comparing the two radiative transfer models (NEMESIS and PSG).",

      "abstract": "Among the known planetary magnetospheres, those of Uranus and Neptune display very similar radio environments so that they have early been referred to as \"radio twins\". They produce a variety of electromagnetic radio waves ranging from ~0 to a few tens of MHz similar to - although more complex than - those of Saturn or the Earth (Desch et al., 1991, Zarka et al., 1995). These include the well known Uranian/Neptunian Kilometric Radiations (UKR/NKR) below 1MHz or the Uranian/Neptunian Electrostatic Discharges (UED/NED) beyond, which remain only known from Voyager 2 radio observations. Here, we present a modern concept of digital High Frequency Receiver (HFR) within the frame of a general Radio and Plasma Wave (RPW) experiment retained in various mission concepts toward Uranus and Neptune (e.g. Hess et al., 2010 ; Arridge et al., 2011, 2013, 2014 Christophe et al., 2011; Masters et al., 2013; Hofstadter at al., 2019). The presented HFR concept, based on the heritage of Cassini/RPWS/HFR, Bepi-Clompobo/PWI/Sorbet, Solar Orbiter/RPW and JUICE/RPWI/JENRAGE is aimed at providing a light, robust, low-consumption versatile instrument capable of goniopolarimetric and waveform measurements from a few kHz to ~20MHz, devoted to the study of auroral and atmospheric radio and plasma waves or dust impacts.",

We call our design the Small Next-generation Atmospheric Probe (SNAP). The primary scientific objective of a multi-probe mission is to reveal spatial variability of atmospheric conditions. This article first highlights that not all measurements must be repeated by multiple probes; some quantities, notably the noble gas abundances and elemental isotopic ratios, are not expected to be variable, and thus need to be performed only by a single large Primary Probe. Our study demonstrates that, by focusing its measurements on spatially variable quantities including atmospheric vapor concentrations, thermal stratification and wind speed, a viable atmospheric probe design is realized with an entry system with 50-cm heatshield diameter and 30-kg atmospheric entry mass.",

      "abstract": "In June 2017, NASA published the Ice Giants Pre-Decadal Survey Mission Study Report which took a fresh look at science priorities and mission concepts for missions to the Uranus and Neptune systems. In addition to science objectives, the team explored the state of required technologies for remote and in-situ science exploration. Notably, three of the four mission architectures considered in the study included an atmospheric probe. More recently, interest has grown within ESA for outer planet exploration. In support of this objective, ESA has performed two CFD studies (January &amp; July 2019) which analyzed the feasibility of stand-alone elements (orbiter and probes) provided by ESA as a part of a NASA led mission to the Uranus or Neptune systems. The first study was carried out by ESA experts with active participation of NASA/JPL. ESA highlighted the necessity to deepen the knowledge characterizing the aerothermal environment of the probes. Entry environments for the NASA study were estimated using an aeroheating correlation that was calibrated to data returned from the Galileo probe entry to Jupiter. For the ESA concept study, aeroheating estimates were made using correlations employed during the design of the Galileo probe. Importantly, these correlations show large discrepancies in predicted total aeroheating (in some cases more than 100%), largely due to differences in the predicted radiative heat load. The magnitude of the disagreement is disconcerting in and of itself, but the problem is made worse by the fact that both correlations are being extrapolated from the extreme Galileo entry conditions to the (relatively) more benign Uranus and Neptune entry. It is likely that neither correlation is providing an accurate assessment of the true aeroheating loads at this time. Given that current NASA predictions are near the limits of existing TPS test capability, and that ESA predictions are more severe, improving the accuracy and associated margins of the prediction is critical to better assess mission feasibility. Recent work in NASA by Cruden (AIAA Paper No. 2015-0380) and Erb (AIAA Paper No. 2019-3360) have substantially improved our fundamental understanding of aerothermodynamics in Hydrogen-Helium atmospheres. Similar work is planned in ESA as well. However, these recent data have not been incorporated into updated design models for Outer Planet probes. In addition, this work does not address the problem of trace atmospheric constituents (such as Methane) that are known to be present in Ice Giant atmospheres and may substantially alter the resulting shock layer radiation signal by providing a ready source of free electrons to initiate excitation processes. The proposed presentation will review the current status of aerothermal modeling for Ice Giant entries and propose a path forward to reduce key uncertainties and enable optimized thermal protection system designs.",

The probe system concept has matured and converged on general design parameters that indicate the probe would include a 1-meter class aeroshell and have a mass around 350 to 400-kg. Probe battery sizes vary, depending on the duration of a post-release coast phase, and assumptions about heaters and instrument power needs.

      "abstract": "A new era of planetary exploration will begin with LUVOIR (Large UV Optical Infrared observatory concept), providing multi-wavelength capabilities at unprecedented spatial resolutions and sensitivities. LUVOIR will be able to map the Kuiper Belt, to explore interstellar visitors and the confines of the Oort Cloud via distant comets as they enter our Solar System, to obtain orders of magnitude greater characterization of asteroids/NEOs, to map the plumes of the icy moons, and to study the atmospheres of planets rivaling of orbital missions, among other transformative advances. With a proposed launch date in the late 2030s two alternative architectures were defined: LUVOIR-A (15-m) and LUVOIR-B (8-m). The observatory will have access to a highly versatile and capable suite of instruments: a) high-resolution imaging in the UV through the near IR (0.2-2.5 um) with a wide-field (2 x 3 arcminute field-of-view) via HDI (High Definition Imager); b) sensitive spectroscopy with ECLIPS (Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems) covering the 0.2-2 um range; c) multi-object UV-IR spectroscopy with LUMOS (LUVOIR Ultraviolet Multi Object Spectrograph) featuring high/medium/low resolution in the 0.1-1 um range, and far-UV imaging modes; d) UV spectro-polarimetry with high resolution point source capability (R = 120,000) provided by POLLUX, a European contribution to LUVOIR. Such an instrument suite associated with a large aperture space observatory would enable orbiter- and flyby-quality observations of many solar system bodies, both large and small. For instance, LUVOIR could perform mapping of many outer Solar System bodies that have not been visited by spacecrafts in recent decades (e.g. Uranus, Neptune) at spatial resolutions comparable to those of the JUNO orbiter for Jupiter. This presentation will include simulated observations of Solar System bodies with the alternative LUVOIR-A and LUVOIR-B configurations and considering different instrument combinations. We will compare these observations with those from past, present and future space telescopes, using real and simulated observations.",

      "abstract": "The Jupiter's moon Europa is believed to be one of the few bodies in the Solar System able to host habitable environments. Compelling evidence for the existence of a subsurface ocean was provided by the magnetic field measurements carried out by the Galileo spacecraft. <P />The NASA/JPL Europa Clipper mission is scheduled for launch in the early 2020s. Due to the harsh Jovian radiation environment and budget limitations, the initial concept of an orbiter was abandoned, and the spacecraft will perform only multiple flybys of the moon. Although Clipper will investigate the surface and subsurface properties with a powerful suite of instruments, such approach is not very favourable to a thorough investigation of Europa's deep interior structure. <P />In 2015 the Europa Clipper project announced the possibility to carry an additional flight element with a mass of about 250 kg. We then started investigating a smallest mission aimed at regaining the original science objectives of Clipper for studying the deep interior structure of Europa. Although this additional mass is no longer available, we describe here a mission concept, based on a mothercraft-daughtercraft configuration, which could be of interest to future exploration missions. Our proposal is based on a small spacecraft, the Europa Tomography Probe (ETP), to be inserted in a polar orbit around Europa with a lifetime of a few months. ETP should carry only a magnetometer and a transponder for inter-satellite link, thus not foreseeing any direct link to ground. By exploiting the magnetic induction effect from Jupiter, the magnetometer will measure Europa's magnetic polarizability, thus providing information on the thickness and conductivity of the internal salty ocean, while the ETP transponder will enable a two-way relay link with the mother spacecraft during Europa flybys. The relay link will be used to transfer telemetry data and to carry out range rate measurements on board Clipper. This configuration minimizes the required power on ETP and provides high quality Doppler observables using an ultra-stable oscillator hosted on Clipper. The limiting noise in Doppler measurements will be the frequency stability of ETP and Clipper relay electronics. Doppler data allow the determination of Europa's static gravity field with high resolution along with its variable part due to eccentricity tides (Love number k<SUB>2</SUB>). Measurements of the moon's gravity also provide accurate data on its rotational state (e.g., Europa's obliquity and libration amplitude). Furthermore, the inter-satellite Doppler observables can improve the accuracy in the determination of Clipper's position relative to Europa at the level of a few meters in the radial direction. The precise positioning of the main spacecraft relative to Europa and the altimetric measurements from the radar REASON could be exploited to measure the tidal displacement (Love number h<SUB>2</SUB>) of the outer icy shell. <P />The NASA's Europa Clipper is viewed as the first applicable study case for the mission concept presented in this paper, which is of general interest to a class of similar flyby missions that can be conceived not only for the Jovian system, but also for Saturn and the ice giants of the solar system, Uranus and Neptune. In the latter case, for example, a small orbiter of Triton could significantly boost the science return from a larger spacecraft focusing on the observation of the planet. In the case of Europa, we show that joint magnetic field, gravity, and possibly altimetric measurements, will place strong constraints on the deep interior structure of the moon and provide a good determination of the ice shell thickness and ocean depth.",

As a case study, we present the advantages, cost and risk of adding SNAP to the future Uranus Orbiter and Probe flagship mission; in combination with the mission's main probe, SNAP would perform atmospheric in-situ measurements at a second location, and thus enable and enhance the scientific objectives recommended by the 2013 Planetary Science Decadal Survey and the 2014 NASA Science Plan to determine atmospheric spatial variabilities. Out study demonstrates that the science objectives can be achieved with a 30-kg entry probe 0.5m in diameter (less than half the size of the Galileo probe) that reaches 5-bar pressure-altitude and returns data to Earth via the carrier spacecraft. As the baseline instruments, the probe will carry an Atmospheric Structure Instrument (ASI) that measures the temperature, pressure and acceleration, a carbon nanotube-based NanoChem atmospheric composition sensor, and an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) to conduct a Doppler Wind Experiment (DWE).

      "abstract": "On September 24, 2023, NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission dropped a capsule to Earth containing ~120 g of pristine carbonaceous regolith from Bennu. We describe the delivery and initial allocation of this asteroid sample and introduce its bulk physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties from early analyses. The regolith is very dark overall, with higher-reflectance inclusions and particles interspersed. Particle sizes range from submicron dust to a stone ~3.5 cm long. Millimeter-scale and larger stones typically have hummocky or angular morphologies. Some stones appear mottled by brighter material that occurs as veins and crusts. Hummocky stones have the lowest densities and mottled stones have the highest. Remote sensing of Bennu's surface detected hydrated phyllosilicates, magnetite, organic compounds, carbonates, and scarce anhydrous silicates, all of which the sample confirms. We also find sulfides, presolar grains, and, less expectedly, Mg,Na-rich phosphates, as well as other trace phases. The sample's composition and mineralogy indicate substantial aqueous alteration and resemble those of Ryugu and the most chemically primitive, low-petrologic-type carbonaceous chondrites. Nevertheless, we find distinct hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopic compositions, and some of the material we analyzed is enriched in fluid-mobile elements. Our findings underscore the value of sample return—especially for low-density material that may not readily survive atmospheric entry—and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive analyses.",

      "abstract": "Asteroids (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu observed by Hayabusa2 and Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) share many global properties, but high-spatial-resolution spectral observations by the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) and MapCam detected subtle but significant differences (e.g., opposite space weathering trends), which may reflect differences in their origin and evolution. Comparing these differences on the same absolute scale is necessary for understanding their causes and obtaining implications for C-complex asteroids. However, ONC-T and MapCam have a large imager-to-imager systematic error of up to 15% caused by the difference in radiometric calibration targets. To resolve this problem, we cross calibrated albedo and color data between the two instruments using the Moon as the common calibration standard. The images of the Moon taken by ONC-T and MapCam were compared with those simulated using photometry models developed from lunar orbiter data. Our results show that the cross-calibrated reflectance of Ryugu and Bennu can be obtained by upscaling the pre-cross-calibrated reflectance of Bennu by 13.3 ± 1.6% at b band, 13.2 ± 1.5% at v band, 13.6 ± 1.7% at w band, and 14.8 ± 1.8% at x band, while those for Ryugu are kept the same. These factors compensate for the imager-to-imager bias caused by differences in targets used for radiometric calibration and solar irradiance models used for data reduction. Need for such large upscaling underscore the importance of using the cross-calibrated data for accurately comparing the Ryugu and Bennu data. The uncertainty in these factors show that the reflectance of Ryugu and Bennu can be compared with &lt;2% accuracy after applying our results. By applying our cross calibration, the geometric albedo of Bennu became consistent with those observed by ground-based telescopes and the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer (OVIRS). Our result can be simply applied by multiplying a constant to the publicly available data and enables accurate comparison of the optical spectra of Ryugu and Bennu in future studies.",

      "abstract": "Carbonaceous asteroids are leftover materials from the early solar system. They did not undergo planetary differentiation processes and thus still retained signatures and clues of the origin and evolution of the solar system. Thus, samples of carbonaceous asteroids provide significant potential for deciphering the origin of the solar system. The Hayabusa2 spacecraft returned the first samples of a carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu. In this work, we report the nanoscale mineralogy and organic matter content of two Ryugu particles, A0030 and C0034. These were analyzed by highly novel scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM)-based nanoscale-Fourier transform infrared (nano-FTIR) spectroscopy with ∼20 nm spatial resolution. The nano-FTIR measurements were supported by confocal micro-Raman imaging and spectroscopy (∼500 nm/pixel spatial sampling). Our investigations show that the two Ryugu particles (a) contain different silicate mineralogies, indicating heterogeneous and incomplete aqueous alteration and (b) are highly rich in organic matter, consisting a variety of molecular functional groups. The spatial distributions of chemical functional groups and their associations based on pseudo-heterodyne (PsHet) SNOM imaging show that the organic matter is distributed as either diffused or discrete grains. Micro-Raman spectra show that the Ryugu particles experienced minimal thermal metamorphism, although A0030 was slightly more heated than C0034. The identification of abundant nanoscale organic molecules within the Ryugu grains that could not be identified via micrometer-scale investigations emphasizes the importance of using nanoscale nondestructive methods for studying primitive solar system materials, such as Ryugu and OSIRIS-Rex particles and those that will be returned in the future (such as MMX samples).",

This simple setup is able to record all the salient features of both the seismic and acoustic wavefields; including the primary shockwave, later reverberations, and possible locally induced surface waves. Peak overpressures of 0.7~Pa and ground velocities of 2x10$^{-6}$~m/s yield lower bound on the air-to-ground coupling factor between 3 and 44~Hz of 1.4x10$^{-6}$m/s/Pa, comparable to results from other re-entries",

      "abstract": "We propose an approach to infer large-scale heterogeneities within a small celestial body from measurements of its gravitational potential, provided for instance by spacecraft radio-tracking. The non-uniqueness of the gravity inversion is here mitigated by limiting the solutions to piecewise-constant density distributions, thus composed of multiple regions of uniform density (mass anomalies) dispersed in a background medium. The boundary of each anomaly is defined implicitly as the 0-level surface of a scalar field (called the level-set function), so that by modifying this field the shape and location of the anomaly are varied. The gravitational potential associated with a density distribution is here computed via a line-integral polyhedron method, yielding the coefficients of its spherical harmonics expansion. The density distribution is then adjusted via an iterative least-squares approach with Tikhonov regularization, estimating at every iteration corrections to the level-set function, the density contrast of each anomaly, and the background density, in order to minimize the residuals between the predicted gravity coefficients and those measured. Given the non-convexity of the problem and the lack of prior knowledge assumed (save for the shape of the body), the estimation process is repeated for several random initial distributions, and the resulting solutions are clustered based on global properties independent of the input measurements. This provides families of candidate interior models in agreement with the data, and the spread of the local density values across each family is used to assess the uncertainties associated with the estimated distributions. We present multiple synthetic tests with increasingly more realistic settings (in terms of gravity resolution and precision, and of shape, size and distribution of the internal heterogeneities), showing that our method is generally able to retrieve a ground-truth mass distribution even with noisy data. For further validation, we present an application of the method to real data, namely the Bennu gravity coefficients measured by the OSIRIS-REx team.",

Here we present a suite of preflight tests conducted to identify the observing geometry and number of images needed to create DTMs that would enable successful navigation around and to the surface of the asteroid. We demonstrate that high-quality DTMs can be generated by using only five images: four that are focused on topography, in which the spacecraft's viewing geometry brackets the target (north, south, east, and west), and a fifth that measures the target's albedo variation, taken from near local noon. We further show that the first 10 iterations of the SPC process can meaningfully improve DTM quality, including in the case of a suboptimal input image set, whereas after 10 iterations the DTM quality approaches an asymptotic maximum. We distill our findings into recommendations for observation planning that can be applied by other missions intending to use SPC to model the shape and terrain of their target.",

Here we describe the extensive testing conducted before launch to certify SPC as NASA Class B flight software, which not only validated SPC for operational use but also quantified the accuracy of this technique. We used a computer-generated digital terrain model (DTM) of a synthetic asteroid as the truth input to render simulated truth images per the planned OSIRIS-REx observing campaign. The truth images were then used as input to SPC to create testing DTMs. Imaging sets, observational parameters, and processing techniques were varied to evaluate their effects on SPC's performance and their relative importance for the quality of the resulting DTMs. We show that the errors in accuracy for SPC models are of the order of the source images' smallest pixel sizes and that a DTM can be created at any scale, provided there is sufficient imagery at that scale. Uncertainty in the spacecraft's flight path has minimal impact on the accuracy of SPC models. Subtraction between two DTMs (truth and simulated) is an effective approach for measuring error but has limitations. Comparing the simulated truth images with images rendered from the SPC-derived DTMs provides an excellent metric for DTM quality at smaller scales and can also be applied in flight by using real images of the target. SPC has limitations near steep slopes (e.g., the sides of boulders), leading to height errors of more than 30%. This assessment of the accuracy and sensitivity of SPC provides confidence in this technique and lessons that can be applied to future missions.",

      "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon-containing chemicals that may evaporate rapidly at room temperature and standard pressure. Such organic compounds can be preserved inside carbonaceous chondrite matrices. However, unlike meteoritic soluble organic matter (SOM) and insoluble organic matter (IOM), VOCs are typically lost (at least in part) during sample processing (meteorite crushing) and exposure to terrestrial atmosphere and/or solvents. Like SOM and IOM, VOCs can provide valuable insights into the chemical inventory of the meteorite parent body and even the presolar cloud from which our solar system formed, as well as the composition and processes that occurred during the early formation of our solar system and the asteroidal stage. Thus, in this work, we designed and built an instrument that allowed us to access the VOCs present in samples of the carbonaceous chondrites Murchison and Sutter's Mill after mineral disaggregation by means of freeze-thaw cycling. We simultaneously evaluated the abundances and compound-specific <SUP>13</SUP>C-distributions of the volatiles evolving after meteorite powdering at ~20, 60, and 100°C. Carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) were released from these meteorites as the most abundant VOCs. They were combusted together for analysis and showed positive δ<SUP>13</SUP>C values, indicative of their extraterrestrial origins. Carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) was also an abundant VOC in both meteorites, and its isotopic values suggest that it was mainly formed from dissolved carbonates in the samples. We also detected aldehydes, ketones, and aromatic compounds in low amounts. Contrary to Murchison, which mostly yielded VOCs with positive δ<SUP>13</SUP>C values, Sutter's Mill yielded VOCs with negative δ<SUP>13</SUP>C values. The less enriched <SUP>13</SUP>C isotope composition of the VOCs detected in Sutter's Mill suggest that they are either terrestrial contaminants, such as VOCs in compressed gas dusters and common laboratory solvents, or compounds disconnected from interstellar sources and/or formed through parent body processing. Understanding the relative abundances and determining the molecular distributions and isotopic compositions of free meteoritic VOCs are key in assessing their extraterrestrial origins and those of chondritic SOM and IOM. Our newly developed technique will be valuable in the study of the samples brought to the Earth from carbonaceous asteroid Bennu by NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission.",

L'TES is build-to-print hardware copy of the OTES instrument flown on OSIRIS-REx. It is a Fourier Transform spectrometer covering the spectral range 5.71-100 μm (1750-100 cm<SUP>−1</SUP>) with spectral sampling intervals of 8.64, 17.3, and 34.6 cm<SUP>−1</SUP> and a 7.3-mrad field of view. The L'TES telescope is a 15.2-cm diameter Cassegrain telescope that feeds a flat-plate Michelson moving mirror mounted on a linear voice-coil motor assembly to a single uncooled deuterated L-alanine doped triglycine sulfate (DLATGS) pyroelectric detector. A significant firmware change from OTES is the ability to acquire interferograms of different length and spectral resolution with acquisition times of 0.5, 1, and 2 seconds. A single ∼0.851 μm laser diode is used in a metrology interferometer to provide precise moving mirror control and IR sampling at 772 Hz. The beamsplitter is a 38-mm diameter, 1-mm thick chemical vapor deposited diamond with an antireflection microstructure to minimize surface reflection.

These local bounds have interesting implications for existing and future direct-detection experiments. Our constraints apply to all dark matter candidates but are particularly meaningful for scenarios including solar halos, stellar basins, and axion miniclusters, which predict overdensities in the solar system.

The system was installed in the OSIRIS-REx cleanroom at NASA's Johnson Space Center to collect data during preliminary examination of the Bennu sample. QRIS uses a 12-bit machine vision camera to measure reflectance over wavelength bands spanning the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Raw data are processed by a calibration pipeline that generates a series of monochromatic, high-dynamic-range reflectance images, as well as band ratio maps, band depth maps, and 3-channel color images. The purpose of these spectral reflectance data is to help characterize lithologies in the sample and compare them to lithologies observed on Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. This initial assessment of lithological diversity was intended to help select the subsamples that will be used to address mission science questions about the early solar system and the origins of life and to provide important context for the selection of representative subsamples for preservation and distribution to international partners. When QRIS imaged the Bennu sample, unexpected calibration issues arose that had not been evident at imaging rehearsals and negatively impacted the quality of QRIS data. These issues were caused by stray light within the lens and reflections off the glovebox window and interior, and were exacerbated by the sample's extremely low reflectance. QRIS data were useful for confirming conclusions drawn from other data, but reflectance and spectral data from QRIS alone unfortunately have limited utility.",

Over the past three decades, the asteroid exploration has evolved from mere flybys to targeted explorations, and eventually to sample return missions. During the process, the types of targets have become more diverse, and the objectives have shifted from purely scientific exploration to asteroid defense and resource utilization. In 2025, China plans the Tianwen-2 asteroid exploration mission and its first asteroid defense mission. To better serve China's future missions, this paper reviews the asteroid exploration history, their scientific goals, payloads, and scientific contributions. For sample return missions, a detailed review of sample storage and distribution management was provided, as well as the preliminary ground laboratory analysis of Hayabusa and Hayabusa 2, and OSIRIS-REx missions.

Although state-of-the-art numerical simulations have allowed for the replication of many macroscopic impact characteristics consistent with observations, the understanding of dynamics and response mechanisms within rubble-pile structures remains incomplete and requires further in-depth investigation. Such understanding is critical for assessing the effects and safety of impact defense missions. The loose structure of rubble-pile asteroids affects inhomogeneous internal stress propagation via inherent force chains, which may lead to structural fracturing. We demonstrate this phenomenon here, using a proof-of-principle two-dimensional model of granular aggregates. We find that the velocity response front to impact disturbances preferentially propagates along pre-existing force chains, with particles not in chains responding more slowly. The sites within the response zone where high dynamic stresses manifest are strongly correlated with these initial force chains, and the damages that result are predominantly located within areas enclosed by these chains. The strong correlation between pre-existing force chains and dynamic response is independent of the location, magnitude, direction of the disturbance velocity, or the aggregate's particle size distribution. All evidence suggests that the core reasons for this propagation preference lie in the structural heterogeneity of granular aggregates and the resulting differences in mechanical wave propagation. This investigation provides guidance for future research aimed at quantitatively assessing fragmentation risks based on the statistical properties of force chains.",

Initial analysis of the Ryugu materials revealed a mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic kinship to the CI chondrites. In this study, we have summarized the elemental abundances of Ryugu samples published to date, and evaluated their compositional variability associated with the CI chondrite data. The abundances of some elements (e.g., P, Ca, Mn, and rare earth elements) in individual Ryugu particles were found to show large relative dispersions compared to the other elements, presumably due to the nugget effect of aqueously formed minor secondary minerals (e.g., dolomite, apatite, magnetite, and pyrrhotite). Consequently, the mean abundances of Ryugu for these elements, calculated using currently available Ryugu data, are accompanied by a certain degree of uncertainties. We suggest establishing a consortium to determine the representative elemental abundances of Ryugu by measuring aliquots from a large homogenized powder sample that can mitigate the nugget effect. Our statistical calculation shows that at least 750 and 400 mg of homogenized samples from Chambers A and C, respectively, are needed to achieve within +/-5% compositional heterogeneity. The data obtained throughout the consortium activity complement the scientific objectives of the Hayabusa2 mission. Moreover, we anticipate that the obtained Ryugu data, coupled with the elemental abundances of CI chondrites, provide new insights into the chemical composition of the Solar System, which will be used by multidisciplinary communities, including Earth and planetary sciences, astronomy, physics, and chemistry.",

      "abstract": "The rotational mass loss has been realized to be a prevalent mechanism to produce low-speed debris near the asteroid, and the size composition of the asteroid's surface regolith has been closely measured by in situ explorations. However, the full-scale evolution of the shedding debris has not been examined using the observed particle sizes, which may hold vital clues to the initial growth of an asteroid moonlet and help us to understand the general mechanisms that dominate the formation of asteroid systems. This paper presents our study on the cumulative evolution of the debris cloud formed by a rotationally unstable asteroid. A semianalytical model is developed to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of the debris cloud posterior to a shedding event. Large-scale discrete element method (DEM) simulations are performed to quantify the clustering behavior of the debris particles in the mechanical environment near the asteroid. As a result, we found that the cumulation of a steady debris cloud is dominated by large pieces of debris, and the shedding particles follow a common migration trend, which fundamentally determines the mass distribution of the debris cloud. For the accretion analysis, we sketched the life cycle of a debris cluster and showed its dependency on particle size. The DEM simulations adopt physical parameters estimated from observations and asteroid missions. The results confirm that porous fluffy cluster structures can form shortly after a shedding event with magnitudes the same as the observed shedding activities. Measurements of these structures show that they themselves possess a certain strength and have the capacity to collisions to absorb dissociative particles that collide with them.",

Two CubeSats onboard Hera plan to perform a ballistic landing on the secondary of the system, called Dimorphos. For these types of landings the translational state during descent is not controlled, reducing the spacecraft's complexity but also increasing its sensitivity to deployment maneuver errors and dynamic uncertainties. This paper introduces a novel methodology to analyze the effect of these uncertainties on the dynamics of the lander and design a trajectory that is robust against them. This methodology consists of propagating the uncertain state of the lander using the nonintrusive Chebyshev interpolation (NCI) technique, which approximates the uncertain dynamics using a polynomial expansion. The results are then analyzed using the pseudo-diffusion indicator. This indicator is derived from the coefficients of the polynomial expansion, which quantifies the rate of growth of the set of possible states of the spacecraft over time. The indicator is used here to constrain the impact velocity and angle to values that allow for successful settling on the surface. This information is then used to optimize the landing trajectory by applying the NCI technique inside the transcription of the problem. The resulting trajectory increases the robustness of the trajectory compared to a conventional method, improving landing success by 20% and significantly reducing the landing footprint.",

In this work, we investigate its structural stability using an advanced soft-sphere-discrete-element-model code, DEMBODY, which is integrated with bonded-aggregate models to simulate highly irregular boulders. The asteroid body is numerically constructed by tens of thousands particles, and then is slowly spun up until structural failure. Rubble piles with different frictions, cohesions, morphologies, grain size distributions, and structures are investigated. We find a 2016 HO<inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0004\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$_3$</tex-math></inline-formula> shaped granular asteroid would undergo tensile failure at higher strengths as opposed to shear failure in lower strengths, regardless of its shape and constituent grain size ratio. In the tensile failure regime, the critical tensile strength is proportional to the square of the spin rate, but surprisingly, is independent of the internal friction angle. Such relations indicate that the Maximum Tensile Stress criterion emerges as superior paradigm for investigating the failure behaviour of fast-rotating asteroids. We predict that the high-spin rate of asteroid 2016 HO<inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0005\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$_3$</tex-math></inline-formula> requires a surface strength over <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0006\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>3 Pa and a bulk tensile strength over <inline-formula><tex-math id=\"TM0007\" notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>10-30 Pa. Through comparing these strength conditions with the latest data from asteroid missions, we suggest a higher likelihood of a monolithic structure over a typical rubble pile structure. However, the possibility of the latter cannot be completely ruled out. In addition, the asteroid's surface could retain a loose regolith layer globally or only near its poles, which could be the target for sampling of Tianwen-2 mission.",

      "abstract": "Previous Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express observations of Phobos and Deimos, the moons of Mars, have improved our understanding of these small bodies. However, their formation and composition remain poorly constrained. Physical and spectral properties suggest that Phobos may be a weakly thermal-altered captured asteroid but the dynamical properties of the martian system suggest a formation by giant collision similar to the Earth moon. In 2027, the JAXA's MMX mission aims to address these outstanding questions. We undertook measurements with a new simulant called OPPS (Observatory of Paris Phobos Simulant) which closely matches Phobos reflectance spectra from the visible to the mid-infrared wavelength range. The simulant was synthesized using a mixture of olivine, saponite, anthracite, and coal. Since observation geometry strongly influences the photometry and spectra of the light reflected from planetary surfaces, we evaluated the parameters obtained by modeling the phase curves – obtained through laboratory measurements – of two different Phobos simulants (UTPS-TB and OPPS) using Hapke IMSA model. Our results show that the photometric properties of Phobos simulants are not fully consistent with those of carbonaceous chondrites and martian meteorites. We also investigated the detection of volatiles/organic compounds and hydrated minerals, as the presence of such components is expected on Phobos in the hypothesis of a captured primitive asteroid. To investigate their detectability, we examined the variability of the 3.28μm and 3.42μm absorption bands related to aliphatic/aromatic carbon (as a proxy of organic material), as well as the 2.7μm O–H feature in a Phobos laboratory spectroscopic simulant. The results indicate that a significant amount of organic compounds is required for the detection of C–H bands at 3.4μm. The bands at 3.28 and 3.42μm are faint (less than 2%) when ∼3 wt% of organic compounds are present in the simulant and are likely undetectable by the MIRS spectrometer onboard the MMX mission. When the concentration of aliphatic and aromatic compounds is increased to 6 wt%, a positive detection starts to become more plausible using remote sensing infrared spectroscopy. In contrast, the 2.7μm absorption band, due to hydrated minerals, is much deeper and easier to detect than C–H organic features at the same concentration levels. The feature is still clearly detectable even when the simulant contains only 3 vol.% of phyllosilicates, corresponding to 0.7 wt% OH groups. Posing limits on detectability of some possible key components of Phobos surface will be pivotal to prepare and interpret future observations of the MIRS spectrometer as well as TENGOO and OROCHI cameras onboard MMX mission.",

      "abstract": "On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 1 m, entering the atmosphere at 40.4 km s$^{-1}$ with an average slope of 8.5$^\\circ$. The luminous phase started at 133 km and ended at an altitude of 54 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit had an inclination of 16.4$^\\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.952, a semimajor axis of 2.4 au, and a short perihelion distance of 0.12 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Fireball and Meteorite Network and the European Space Agency, as well as by the U.S. Government sensors from space. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, with a deviation of 0.56$^\\circ$ and 0.1 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The presence of detached fragments in the lower part of the luminous trajectory suggests that the meteoroid was a polymict carbonaceous chondrite, containing higher-strength macroscopic particles in its interior due to collisional gardening, or a thermally processed C-type asteroid. The orbital elements indicate that the most likely source is the Jupiter-Family Comet region, aligning with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory comet family, as its sunskirting orbit is decoupled from Jupiter. This event provides important information to characterize the disruption mechanism of near-Sun objects.",

Nevertheless, the physical and compositional properties that cause their polarimetric distinctiveness are less investigated. Aims. We aim to investigate the polarimetric uniqueness of Ch-type asteroids by making databases of various observational quantities (i.e., spectroscopic and photometric properties as well as polarimetric ones) of dark asteroids. Methods. We conducted an intensive polarimetric survey of 52 dark asteroids (including 31 Ch-type asteroids) in the R<SUB>C</SUB> band to increase the size of polarimetric samples. The observed data were compiled with previous polarimetric, spectroscopic, and photometric archival data to find their correlations. Results. We find remarkable correlations between these observed quantities, particularly the depth of NPBs and their spectroscopic features associated with the hydrated minerals. The amplitude of the opposition effect in photometric properties also shows correlations with polarimetric and spectral properties. However, these observed quantities do not show noticeable correlations with the geometric albedo, thermal inertia, and diameter of asteroids. Conclusions. Based on the observational evidence, we arrive at our conclusion that the submicrometer-sized structures (fibrous or flaky puff pastry-like structures in phyllosilicates) in the regolith particles could contribute to the distinctive NPBs of hydrated asteroids.",

      "abstract": "Hera represents the European Space Agency's inaugural planetary defense space mission and plays a pivotal role in the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment international collaboration with NASA DART mission that performed the first asteroid deflection experiment using the kinetic impactor techniques. With the primary objective of conducting a detailed post-impact survey of the Didymos binary asteroid following the DART impact on its small moon called Dimorphos, Hera aims to comprehensively assess and characterize the feasibility of the kinetic impactor technique in asteroid deflection while conducting an in-depth investigation of the asteroid binary, including its physical and compositional properties as well as the effect of the impact on the surface and shape of Dimorphos. In this work, we describe the Hera radio science experiment, which will allow us to precisely estimate critical parameters, including the mass, which is required to determine the momentum enhancement resulting from the DART impact, mass distribution, rotational states, relative orbits, and dynamics of the asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos. Through a multi-arc covariance analysis, we present the achievable accuracy for these parameters, which consider the full expected asteroid phase and are based on ground radiometric, Hera optical images, and Hera to CubeSats InterSatellite Link radiometric measurements. The expected formal uncertainties for Didymos and Dimorphos GM are better than 0.01% and 0.1%, respectively, while their J<SUB>2</SUB> formal uncertainties are better than 0.1% and 10%, respectively. Regarding their rotational state, the absolute spin pole orientations of the bodies can be recovered to better than 1°, and Dimorphos' spin rate to better than 10<SUP>‑3</SUP>%. Dimorphos reconstructed relative orbit can be estimated at the sub-m level. Preliminary results, using a higher-fidelity dynamical model of the coupled motion between rotational and orbital dynamics, show uncertainties in the main parameters of interest that are comparable to those in standard radio science models. A first-order estimate of the expected uncertainty in the momentum transfer efficiency from DART's impact, obtainable with Hera, yields a value of about 0.25. This represents a significant improvement compared to current estimates. Overall, the retrieved values meet the Hera radio science requirements and goals, and remain valid under the condition that the system is determined to be in an excited but non-chaotic (or tumbling) state. The Hera radio science experiment will play an integral role in the exploration of the Didymos binary asteroid system and will provide unique scientific measurements, which, when combined with other observables such as optical images, altimetry measurements, and satellite-to-satellite tracking of the CubeSats, will support the mission's overarching goals in planetary defense and the deep understanding of binary asteroids.",

      "abstract": "The Gaia mission has provided astrometric observations of unprecedented accuracy for more than 156,000 asteroids. The reported astrometric uncertainties are of the order of milliarcseconds, about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of traditional ground-based observations. The accuracy of Gaia data requires a high-fidelity orbit determination process, especially in the observation modeling. We present a statistical analysis of Gaia Focused Product Release to test the accuracy of the reported positions and associated uncertainties. We find that center-of-light offsets due to phase variations need to be modeled to properly fit the observational data. Prediction tests show that the uncertainty in the fitted orbits can be optimistic unless the observational uncertainty is inflated to account for errors in finding the center-of-mass of the body. Moreover, errors in the masses of small-body perturbers can cause differences in the orbital solution that exceed formal uncertainties of the best constrained orbits. As an example, we provide an update of the impact hazard analysis of 1950 DA, one of the asteroids observed by Gaia, and find that the impact probability in the year 2880 increases to 3.8 × 10<SUP>‑4</SUP>.",

      "abstract": "The recently developed flexible lander offers a potential option for future asteroid landing missions due to its advantages in suppression of rebound and overturning. The strong nonlinear dynamics and control constraints of the flexible lander hinder the online implementation of optimal attitude feedback control. To generate the optimal attitude control rapidly, a constrained inhomogeneous approximating sequence of Riccati equations (CI-ASRE) method is proposed. The saturation function is firstly constructed to incorporate control magnitude constraints into dynamics so that the constraints can be analytically handled. Subsequently, to avoid singularity, a partial factorization strategy is proposed to convert the constrained dynamics into two parts, a pseudolinear term and an inhomogeneous term. This factorization enables the nonlinear problem to be expressed as the limit of a sequence of inhomogeneous linear quadratic problems while avoiding local linearization. At last, the analytical CI-ASRE is newly derived to iteratively solve these problems to rapidly obtain optimal feedback control. The computational simplicity and effectiveness of the CI-ASRE method overcome difficulties of optimal attitude control problems of the flexible lander associated with control constraints, strong nonlinearity, and online feedback control generation. The effectiveness of the proposed method for the flexible lander is verified using a landing scenario on asteroid 433 Eros.",

      "abstract": "Shape modeling is an indispensable task for spacecraft exploration of small planetary bodies. Traditional image-based techniques, such as stereo-photogrammetry or structure-from-motion + multi-view stereo, and stereo-photoclinometry, typically use a large number of images taken under favorable conditions for fine shape modeling, often requiring a long time for data acquisition and processing. Here, a novel neural implicit method, encoded by fully connected neural networks, is proposed for shape modeling using a sparse image set. The positions of surrounding points (SPs) with multi-scale receptive fields of a given input point are used as additional inputs for the network training, providing neighboring information. For fine-scale terrain features, a mask-based classification sampling strategy is developed to mitigate over-smoothing encountered by neural implicit methods. The effectiveness of our method is validated on two asteroids of distinct shapes, Itokawa and Ryugu, using 52 and 70 images, respectively. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the mask-based strategy, combined with the SPs configuration, accelerates network convergence for extracting fine surface details while minimizing the occurrence of artifacts. The proposed method can generate comprehensive shape models even in regions with restricted camera coverage, and the resulting models are consistent with those from traditional methods using larger image sets. Besides, the training process is executed in an end-to-end fashion, requiring limited manual intervention, and our method can readily be applied to other small planetary bodies. The source code and generated shape models in this study are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10909252.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents dynamics and control of orbits around an asteroid that is modelled as a uniformly rotating homogeneous rectangular parallelepiped (HRP). Aside from the non-uniform gravitational field of the asteroid, we include the solar radiation pressure (SRP) as a perturbing force. A simple model based on the polyhedral method is employed for calculating the gravity around the HRP. First, circular periodic orbits are identified both in the presence and absence of solar radiation pressure. Then, families of general non-circular periodic orbits in the presence of SRP are determined and subsequently analysed for stability. Next, for a general orbit in the equatorial plane, its stability against a catastrophic impact of an orbiting spacecraft onto the asteroid's surface is checked in the presence of SRP. Orbits, where the solar radiation pressure is less/more dominant over the central body's gravity, are identified with the aim of finding the best orbits for parking a spacecraft. Then, for long-period orbits, SRP is averaged and the time averaged evolution of the orbital elements is obtained. For a special set of initial condition, a closed form solution for the evolution of the orbital eccentricity is obtained. Using this solution, a lower limit for the life-time of a spacecraft that is left uncontrolled is derived in a closed form. Finally, active control strategies are developed for orbit-keeping ofspacecraft for any choice of orbital parameters. A linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed to track a given Keplerian orbit with minimum fuel expenditure. Fuel expenditure on various orbits are calculated and compared to determine the orbits of cheapest operation. The work presented is applicable to small body (asteroids and comets) exploration missions which require online cancellation of the perturbing forces with minimal knowledge of the accurate shape, size, and composition of the small body prior to the mission.",

      "abstract": "Investigating the effects of space-weathering on primitive bodies is paramount in assessing their composition and understanding their history. For this purpose, we conducted 40 keV He and Ar ion-implantation experiments on terrestrial phyllosilicates, the main components of primitive C-class asteroids: two serpentines, and one saponite. We emulated the effects of the solar wind component of space weathering on hydrated surfaces over timescales of 1E3–4 years in the inner solar system. Spectral changes (from 0.35 to 30 μm in wavelength), surface topography variations, and elemental and morphological changes were investigated. In the visible range, we saw darkening for all samples, accompanied by reddening for the serpentine samples and blueing for the saponite. Spectroscopic features such as the silicate stretching and bending modes at 10 and 20 μm respectively, as well as the (M)-OH bending mode at 16 μm, exhibited a peak shift towards longer wavelength (red-shift), band area decrease, and band widening. The surface of Ar-implanted samples appeared polished, while no difference was noticeable for He-implanted samples. Morphological changes in the ion-implanted layers of our samples include abundant vesiculation and lattice amorphization. Mg and O appear to be particularly mobile upon ion implantation. In particular, dehydroxylation was observed for all samples. Changes observed for spectroscopic features do not correlate systematically with variations of the Mg/Fe ratio. They do correlate with oxygen loss via dehydroxylation and crystal lattice disordering and amorphization. Spectral changes in the visible range and for 10 and 20 μm features appear to be mainly due to crystal amorphization. Variation of the hydration feature at 16 μm correlates with both dehydroxylation and lattice amorphization. Compositional variations affect the hydration feature at 2.7 μm more consistently. The effects detected upon ion implantation on the samples in this work support the identification of spectral trends from the remote-sensing data of primitive bodies Ryugu and Bennu as changes induced by space-weathering. Findings are also compatible with laboratory analysis on returned weathered grains from Ryugu.",

We first relate the amplitude and frequency of surface vibrations to the location and severity of an impact, and the rubble body's geometry and bulk properties. For illustration, the body is taken to be an ellipsoid with size and spin close to that of Itokawa, although more complex asteroid shapes may be incorporated. We then model the body's collisional history stochastically given the variability in the impact activity on an asteroid. Finally, we use discrete element simulations to investigate the regolith's response to impacts. In these simulations, in any sample collisional history, every time an impact occurs, a bin filled with a grain mixture and located at the region of interest on the asteroid is vibrated at that impact's associated amplitude and frequency. Using this framework, we find that impact-driven seismicity is sufficient to drive size segregation on small rubble-piles, but the segregation quality depends on several aspects, e.g. total impact energy supplied, placement of the region of interest, bulk wave speed and seismic diffusivity.",

Ground based radar observations predicted that such shape was compatible with the uncertainty along the direction of the asteroid spin axis. Indeed, Didymos shows crater and landslide features, and evidence for boulder motion at low equatorial latitudes. Altogether, the primary seems to have undergone sudden structural failure in its recent history, which may even result in the formation of the secondary. The high eccentricity of Didymos sets its aphelion distance inside the inner main belt, where it spends more than 1/3 of its orbital period and it may undergo many more collisions than in the NEA region. In this work, we investigate the collisional environment of this asteroid and estimate the probability of collision with multi-size potential impactors. We analyze the possibility that such impacts produced the surface features observed on Didymos by comparing collisional intervals with estimated times for surface destabilization by the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. We find that collisional effects dominate over potential local or global deformation due to YORP spin up.",

Our understanding of the spectroscopic behavior of low-albedo surfaces remains incomplete. To improve the interpretation of remote sensing data, laboratory studies continue to serve as a pivotal tool for unveiling the physical state and composition of such surfaces. <BR /> Aims: Several processes can be simulated in the laboratory, however, the preparation and analysis of a complex mixing of analog material is one of the most fundamental among them, while also being one of the most complex when multiple components are used. In this work, we aim to study how dark material mixed with basaltic material at different grain sizes can affect the spectroscopic features from the near- to mid- infrared (1.25-25 µm). <BR /> Methods: Our sample set includes four series of basaltic mix (feldspar and pyroxene) at different grain sizes from &lt;50 µm to 1000 µm, mixed with amorphous carbon at increasing weight percentages ranging from 1% to 50%. We analyzed several features on the spectrum of each mineral mixture. In particular, we investigated the behavior of the: (i) near-infrared slope; (ii) 2.7 µm OH-stretching band; (iii) Christiansen features; and (iv) Reststrahlen band and Transparency feature. <BR /> Results: The measurements presented in this work, which take into account a large wavelength range for the first time, point toward a critical effect of dark material, but with a different outcomes for each grain size. Some of the most interesting results involve the slope trend of modification with dark material and the variant behavior of the Reststrahlen band and Transparency feature. <BR /> Conclusions: This dataset will offer a key support in the interpretation of data collected on dark surfaces by past and future space missions. This knowledge will be also important in the context of linking analyses of returned samples with remote sensing data collected on planetary surfaces.",

      "abstract": "The Mighei-like carbonaceous (CM) chondrites have been altered to various extents by water-rock reactions on their parent asteroid(s). This aqueous processing has destroyed much of the primary mineralogy of these meteorites, and the degree of alteration is highly heterogeneous at both the macroscale and nanoscale. Many CM meteorites are also heavily brecciated juxtaposing clasts with different alteration histories. Here we present results from the fine-grained team consortium study of the Winchcombe meteorite, a recent CM chondrite fall that is a breccia and contains eight discrete lithologies that span a range of petrologic subtypes (CM2.0-2.6) that are suspended in a cataclastic matrix. Coordinated multitechnique, multiscale analyses of this breccia reveal substantial heterogeneity in the extent of alteration, even in highly aqueously processed lithologies. Some lithologies exhibit the full range and can comprise nearly unaltered coarse-grained primary components that are found directly alongside other coarse-grained components that have experienced complete pseudomorphic replacement by secondary minerals. The preservation of the complete alteration sequence and pseudomorph textures showing tochilinite-cronstedtite intergrowths are replacing carbonates suggest that CMs may be initially more carbonate rich than previously thought. This heterogeneity in aqueous alteration extent is likely due to a combination of microscale variability in permeability and water/rock ratio generating local microenvironments as has been established previously. Nevertheless, some of the disequilibrium mineral assemblages observed, such as hydrous minerals juxtaposed with surviving phases that are typically more fluid susceptible, can only be reconciled by multiple generations of alteration, disruption, and reaccretion of the CM parent body at the grain scale.",

The BRDF dataset was fitted using the Hapke BRDF model to (1) provide a method of comparison to other meteorites and asteroids, and (2) to produce Hapke parameter values that can be used to extrapolate the BRDF to all angles. The study deduced the following Hapke parameters for Winchcombe: w = 0.152 ± 0.030, b = 0.633 ± 0.064, and h<SUB>S</SUB> = 0.016 ± 0.008, demonstrating that it has a similar w value to Tagish Lake (0.157 ± 0.020) and a similar b value to Orgueil (0.671 ± 0.090). Importantly, the surface profile of the sample was characterized using an Alicona 3D® instrument, allowing two of the free parameters within the Hapke model φ and θ&gt;¯, which represent porosity and surface roughness, respectively, to be constrained as φ = 0.649 ± 0.023 and θ&gt;¯ = 16.113° (at 500 μm size scale).

However, the spectral properties of these asteroids from 2.5–5 μm, a wavelength region that covers signatures of hydrated minerals, water, and organics, have not yet been explored. Here, we present 2–5 μm reflectance spectra of five spinel-rich asteroids obtained with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. All five targets exhibit a ∼2.85 μm absorption feature with a band depth of 3%–6% that appears correlated in strength with that of the 2 μm spinel absorption feature. The shape and position of the 2.85 μm feature are not a good match to the 2.7 μm feature commonly seen in carbonaceous CM meteorites or C-type asteroids. The closest spectral matches are to the Moon and Vesta, suggesting commonalities in aqueous alteration across silicate bodies, infall of hydrated material, and/or space weathering by solar wind H implantation. Lab spectra of CO/CV chondrites, CAIs, as well as the minerals cronstedtite and spinel, also show a similar feature, providing clues into the origin of the 2.85 μm feature.",

This study proposes a paradigm shift from the proposals currently found in the literature for autonomous asteroid exploration, which inherit the conservative architecture from the ground-in-the-loop approach that relies heavily on reducing uncertainties before close-proximity operations. Instead, it advocates for robust guidance and control to handle uncertainties directly, without extensive navigation campaigns. From a series of conservative assumptions, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of this autonomous GNC for robotic spacecraft by using existing technology. It is shown that a bolder operational approach enables autonomous spacecraft to significantly reduce exploration time by weeks or months. This paradigm shift holds great potential for reducing costs and saving time in autonomous missions of the future.",

Here, we examine samples retrieved from the asteroid Ryugu by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft and discover the presence of nonmagnetic framboids through electron holography measurements that can visualize magnetic flux. Magnetite particles, which normally provide a record of the nebular magnetic field, have lost their magnetic properties by reduction via a high-velocity (&gt;5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) impact of a micrometeoroid with a diameter ranging from 2 to 20 μm after destruction of the parent body of Ryugu. Around these particles, thousands of metallic-iron nanoparticles with a vortex magnetic domain structure, which could have recorded a magnetic field in the impact event, are found. Through measuring the remanent magnetization of the iron nanoparticles, future studies are expected to elucidate the nature of the nebular/interplanetary magnetic fields after the termination of aqueous alteration in an asteroid.",

      "abstract": "On 2022 September 26, NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) successfully hit Dimorphos, the smaller companion of the binary system formed with the asteroid (65803) Didymos. Both the binary system and the impact event were imaged by the Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids, detached from DART 15 days before the impact. Images from the onboard LUKE red, green, and blue camera together with ground-based observations enabled the reconstruction of Didymos's brightness phase curve, with phase angles ranging from 2.35° to 107.7°. The opposition effect regime was studied using the exponential-linear equation, the \"Shevchenko\" function and the linear-by-parts model while the IAU-official HG1G2 magnitude system was applied to the full phase curve. The opposition effect indicates an unusual asteroid surface for an S type, with characteristics similar to M-type asteroids. While the HG1G2 parameters from the full phase curve place Didymos well among asteroids of the taxonomic C complex. Didymos's phase curve parameters when compared to near-Earth asteroids are very close to the Q type (1862) Apollo, indicating possible depletion of fine submicrometric grains through resurfacing. Didymos's geometric albedo (0.15 ± 0.01) is reported to be 30%–45% smaller than the average geometric albedo for near-Earth S types (0.26 ± 0.04). We propose that Didymos might be an LL ordinary chondrite analog containing albedo-suppressing, shock-darkened/impact melt minerals that have undergone resurfacing processes in the past. A comparison with meteorites indicates that, less likely, Didymos could also contain materials analog to carbon-bearing brecciated L3 ordinary chondrites.",

We explore the spectral properties of the Erigone asteroid family in the near-infrared to probe this hypothesis. To get a closer look at the family, we observed 25 family members over an observational campaign from 2014b-2016b utilizing the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. The objects are analyzed by determining the taxonomic classification and spectral gradient values. The spectral gradient results display a compact, primarily reddened range of values in agreement with the primitive types identified through taxonomic classification. Erigone is found to be composed of C- and X-complex types as well as various end-members (L- and T-types). All objects classified as C-complex belong to either Ch- or Cgh-types, types that exhibit hydration in the visible region, aligning with the results of the Erigone family being highly hydrated. We find that trends pointing at the existence of Erigone-like and Polana-like groups in the visible do not appear in the analysis of the near-infrared data. An additional analysis of the Lucy mission target, (52246) Donaldjohanson, was performed and determined to be a probable true member of the Erigone family. Understanding the distribution and extent of hydration in the main asteroid belt contributes to understanding the solar system's evolution. It provides insight into the implications of primitive bodies being a possible source of Earth's water.",

In particular, this study focuses on characterizing the unpolished surface of meteorite samples, which can be likened to the surfaces of boulders on small bodies. We use surface roughness metrics such as the mean (bidirectional) slope and a Hapke mean slope angle in order to characterize the surface texture of the samples. Furthermore, considering a fractal roughness of the surface we estimate the Hurst exponent and the associated scaling factor at an arbitrary scale of ∼60 μm. We find that on the ∼4 μm scale, the mean bidirectional slope and the mean Hapke slope are in the range of 20-40° and 15-35° respectively, with carbonaceous chondrites collectively exhibiting the lowest average value for both. Furthermore, we provide surface roughness measurements for a subsample of the Ryugu sample A0008, which is broadly in agreement with the measurements derived from MASCam data. This study also investigated intra-sample heterogeneities, specifically surface roughness variations between matrix and non-matrix components such as impact melt, shock veins, and chondrules. The results suggest that surface roughness variations exist between these components and the matrix, however, the amplitude of the variation is strongly influenced by the petrological homogeneity of the chosen region of interest.",

By investigating the physical and dynamical changes induced by this interaction, valuable insights into asteroid cohesion, strength, and internal structure can be obtained. In light of these circumstances, a fast mission to Apophis holds great scientific importance and potential for understanding potentially hazardous asteroids. To this aim, ESA proposed the mission RAMSES (Rapid Apophis Mission for SEcurity and Safety) to reach Apophis before its close encounter. In this context, the paper focuses on the reachability analysis of (99942) Apophis, examining thousands of trajectories departing from Earth and reaching the asteroid before the fly-by, using a low-thrust spacecraft. A two-layer approach combining direct sequential convex programming and an indirect method is employed for fast and reliable trajectory optimization.

The spin-up of the asteroid leads to surface instability and eventually triggers regolith failure, followed by landslide and mass shedding on the asteroid's surface. <BR> Aims: We explore the dynamics of the rotation-induced resurfacing and shedding, paying special attention to the dependence of post-shedding evolution on regolith mechanical properties, such as cohesion. <BR> Methods: We propose a qualitative semi-analytical model to explore the post-failure dynamics of a fast-rotating asteroid. We also consider the interaction between the surface mass rearrangement and the asteroid's spin status. We used our model to investigate the surface region where the failure occurs, as well as the total mass shed from the surface and the spin-down of the asteroid in this process. <BR> Results: Based on our model, all the possible avalanche events following a regolith failure can be classified into four basic types: resurfacing (ReS), shedding and resurfacing (S&amp;ReS), shed and bound (S-Bound), and shedding and escaping (S-Escp). Their corresponding regions in the parameter space are illustrated in this work. Our results show that although the regolith cohesion is very small (≲1-2 Pa), cohesion plays an important role in the onset of the avalanche. Moreover, our model qualitatively reconstructs the links between the regolith's properties and the dynamical fates of the shed material. The timescale of YORP-induced shedding events is also discussed in this work.",

Asteroid and comet surfaces are exposed to a complex environment that includes low gravity, high temperature gradients, and a bombardment of micrometeorites and cosmic rays. Surface material exposed to this environment evolves in a specific way depending on various factors such as the bodies' size, heliocentric distance, and composition. Fractures in boulders, as seen on asteroid Ryugu, can help to determine and constrain the dominant processes eroding small-body surface materials. It is also possible to estimate fracture growth timescales based on the abundance and length of fractures in boulders. <BR /> Aims: We analyse the number, orientation, and length of fractures on asteroid Ryugu to establish the relation between the fractures and the processes that may have formed them. We also compare our results to similar investigations conducted on other small bodies and estimate the timescale of fracture growth. <BR /> Methods: 198 high-resolution Hayabusa2 images of asteroid Ryugu suitable for our fracture analysis were selected and map-projected. Within these images, fractures in boulders were manually mapped using the QGIS software. The fracture coordinates were extracted and the fractures' orientation and length were computed for 1521 identified fractures. <BR /> Results: Fractures in boulders on asteroid Ryugu are found to be preferentially north-south aligned, suggesting a formation through thermal erosion. Modeling the fracture length indicates a fracture growth timescale of 30 000 to 40 000 yr, slightly younger than ages found previously for asteroid Bennu. The errors in these ages, due to uncertainties about the thermophysical parameters used in this model, are substantial (−33 000 yr +250 000 yr). However, even with these large errors, the model suggests that thermal fracturing is a geologically fast process. These times are not too dissimilar to those quoted in the literature for Ryugu and Bennu, since similar thermophysical material parameters for Ryugu and Bennu seem likely.",

Therefore, a strong effort has been required on Earth to fully characterise these kinds of interactions and regolith utilisation methods. This operation can only be performed by using regolith simulants, soils that are reproduced with the Earth's rocks and minerals to match the real features. This article presents the main guidelines and tests for obtaining the properties of a generic simulant in terms of composition, physical and mechanical properties, solid-fluid interaction, and thermal properties. These parameters are needed for the designing and testing of payloads under development for planned lunar surface missions. The same tests can be performed on lunar, martian, or asteroid simulants/soils, both in laboratory and in situ. A case study is presented on the lunar simulant NU-LHT-2M, representative of the lunar highlands. The tests are performed in the context of an in situ resource utilisation (ISRU) process that aims to extract oxygen from the lunar regolith using a low-temperature carbothermal reduction process, highlighting the main regolith-related criticalities for an in situ demonstrator plant.",

Most polarimetric studies on airless bodies thus far have focused on optical wavelengths (λ ≲ 1 µm). <BR /> Aims: We conducted polarimetry of two large airless bodies, the Dawn mission targets (1) Ceres and (4) Vesta, in the near-infrared region. We further investigated the change in the polarimetric phase curves over the wavelengths expected from previous works. <BR /> Methods: We used the Nishiharima Infrared Camera (NIC) installed at the Nishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory (NHAO) to observe these objects at multiple geometric configurations in the J, H, and K<SUB>s</SUB> bands (λ ~ 1.2-2.3 µm). <BR /> Results: Polarimetric parameters were determined and compared with previously reported experimental results. In particular, Vesta exhibits a characteristic change in the negative polarization branch as the wavelength increases to the K<SUB>s</SUB> band, which we interpret as an indication of the dominant existence of D ~ 10-20 µm particles. Our approach is supported by empirical reasoning and coincides well with an independent, theory-driven approach based on thermal modeling. <BR /> Conclusions: This work demonstrates how near-infrared polarimetry can be utilized to quantitatively determine the particle size of airless objects.

      "abstract": "On 26 September 2022, NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission successfully impacted Dimorphos, the natural satellite of the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos. Numerical simulations of the impact provide a means to find the surface material properties and structures of the target that are consistent with the observed momentum deflection efficiency, ejecta cone geometry and ejected mass. Our simulation that best matches the observations indicates that Dimorphos is weak, with a cohesive strength of less than a few pascals, like asteroids (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. We find that the bulk density of Dimorphos ρ<SUB>B</SUB> is lower than ~2,400 kg m<SUP>−</SUP><SUP>3</SUP> and that it has a low volume fraction of boulders (≲40 vol%) on the surface and in the shallow subsurface, which are consistent with data measured by the DART experiment. These findings suggest that Dimorphos is a rubble pile that might have formed through rotational mass shedding and reaccumulation from Didymos. Our simulations indicate that the DART impact caused global deformation and resurfacing of Dimorphos. ESA's upcoming Hera mission may find a reshaped asteroid rather than a well-defined crater.",

      "abstract": "Chondrules probably formed during a small window of time ~1-4 Ma after CAIs, when most solid matter in the asteroid belt was already in the form of km-sized planetesimals. They are unlikely, therefore, to be \"building blocks\" of planets or abundant on asteroids, but more likely to be a product of energetic events common in the asteroid belt at that epoch. Laboratory experiments indicate that they could have formed when solids of primitive composition were heated to temperatures of ~1600 K and then cooled for minutes to hours. A plausible heat source for this is magma, which is likely to have been abundant in the asteroid belt at that time, and only that time, due to the trapping of <SUP>26</SUP>Al decay energy in planetesimal interiors. Here, we propose that chondrules formed during low-speed (≲1 km s−1) collisions between large planetesimals when heat from their interiors was released into a stream of primitive debris from their surfaces. Heating would have been essentially instantaneous and cooling would have been on the dynamical time scale, 1/&lt;msqrt&gt;&lt;mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\"&gt;Gρ&lt;/mfenced&gt;&lt;/msqrt&gt; ~30 min, where ρ is the mean density of a planetesimal. Many of the heated fragments would have remained gravitationally bound to the merged object and could have suffered additional heating events as they orbited and ultimately accreted to its surface. This is a hybrid of the splash and flyby models: We propose that it was the energy released from a body's molten interior, not its mass, that was responsible for chondrule formation by heating primitive debris that emerged from the collision.",

Understanding the characteristics of orbital dynamics in the vicinity of asteroids is essential for the successful execution of asteroid exploration missions. Focusing on the asteroid 4660 Nereus, this paper studies the equilibrium points of it and the potentially natural, long-lifetime orbits subject to perturbations from both the asteroid's non-spherical gravitational field and the solar radiation pressure (SRP). Using the semi-analytical method based on averaged Lagrange planetary equations (LPEs), heliotropic and terminator orbits are found more likely to have long lifetimes. It is noteworthy that the conventional near-equatorial heliotropic orbits around Nereus struggle to maintain a long lifetime. In contrast, orbits characterized by a specific inclination and geometry where the apocenter approximately points toward the Sun tend to offer prolonged lifetimes. Moreover, the impact of variations in SRP, gravitational parameter, and pole direction on feasibility of long-term orbit solutions has been explored, resulting in an enhanced comprehension of the intricate orbital dynamics. This study contributes valuable insights for the design of exploration orbits in the vicinity of the Nereus asteroid.",

The low flux conditions for H<SUP>+</SUP> and He<SUP>+</SUP> irradiation were ~1-1.5 orders of magnitude lower than the high flux conditions, and each experiment was irradiated to a total fluence between ~3 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> to ~6 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> ions/cm<SUP>2</SUP>. Irradiation-induced changes in the surface chemistry and optical properties of the Murchison samples were evaluated using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIR). We characterized the microstructure and composition of ion damaged rims in focused ion beam (FIB) cross-sections extracted from olivine and matrix material in each irradiated Murchison slab using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XPS results suggest that both low flux and high flux H<SUP>+</SUP> and He<SUP>+</SUP> irradiation cause minor sputtering of surface carbon as well as a reduction in the valence state of iron, from Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> to Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>. Slope bluing is observed in VNIR spectra of the irradiated samples which may reflect carbonization and dehydrogenation of organic species and contrasts with reddening trends associated with npFe<SUP>0</SUP> formation. Although we do not observe a strong flux-dependence on the crystallinity of ion-damaged olivine, TEM analyses reveal a variety of microstructures in all olivine FIB-sections, suggesting that crystallographic orientation may affect amorphization efficiency. Analyses of matrix FIB-sections indicate that phyllosilicate alteration is mainly driven by He<SUP>+</SUP> irradiation, where the higher incident flux leads to greater amorphization and the formation of more distinct ion-damaged layers, similar to smooth layers in returned Ryugu particles. TEM results also provide some evidence that higher ion flux leads to greater vesiculation, with He<SUP>+</SUP> irradiation being more efficient at vesiculation than H<SUP>+</SUP> irradiation, and promotes the segregation of Mg and Si into laterally extensive lenses and layers in olivine samples. We discuss the implications of these findings for constraining the role that ion flux plays in the development of space weathering characteristics in silicate phases present in carbonaceous asteroidal regoliths. These results will be important for understanding the complexity of this process and how it operates on carbon-rich airless bodies like asteroids Bennu and Ryugu.",

The recent Hayabusa2 sample return mission to asteroid Ryugu offers the first opportunity to study these effects, in the case of the most abundant spectral type among the main-asteroid belt, C-type objects. This study employs vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope to achieve the spatial resolution required to measure the distinct mid-infrared spectral signature of Ryugu's space-weathered surface. The comparison with the spectrum of the pristine underlying matrix reveals the loss of structural -OH and C-rich components in the space-weathered layers, providing direct experimental evidence that exposure to the space environment tends to mask the optical signatures of phyllosilicates and carbonaceous matter. Our findings should contribute to rectifying potential underestimations of water and carbon content of C-type asteroids when studied through remote sensing with new-generation telescopes.",

      "abstract": "Numerous analytical radar-scattering laws have been published through the past decades to interpret planetary radar observations, such as Hagfors' law, which has been commonly used for the Moon, and the cosine law, which is commonly used in the shape modeling of asteroids. Many of the laws have not been numerically validated in terms of their interpretation and limitations. This paper evaluates radar-scattering laws for self-affine fractal surfaces using a numerical approach. Traditionally, the autocorrelation function and, more recently, the Hurst exponent, which describes the self-affinity, have been used to quantify the height correlation. Here, hundreds of three-dimensional synthetic surfaces parameterized using a root-mean-square (rms) height and a Hurst exponent were generated, and their backscattering coefficient functions were computed to evaluate their consistency with selected analytical models. The numerical results were also compared to empirical models for roughness and radar-scattering measurements of Hawaii lava flows and found consistent. The Gaussian law performed best at predicting the rms slope regardless of the Hurst exponent. Consistent with the literature, it was found to be the most reliable radar-scattering law for the inverse modeling of the rms slopes and the Fresnel reflection coefficient from the quasi-specular backscattering peak, when homogeneous statistical properties and a ray-optics approach can be assumed. The contribution of multiple scattering in the backscattered power increases as a function of rms slope up to about 20% of the backscattered power at normal incidence when the rms slope angle is 46°.",

We explore the potential of kilometre-sized binary asteroids as targets for seismological studies of their interior structure. We use a numerical model wherein each body is constructed of discrete particles interacting via gravity and contact forces. The system's orbital properties are modelled based on those of typical binary NEAs: a secondary body orbits a primary body at a distance of a few to 10 primary radii, resulting in orbital periods of a few tens of hours. We varied the elastic moduli (stiffness) of the constituent particles and measured a strain of a few micrometres caused by the orbiting satellite. Over eight orbital periods, the acceleration of the strain vector along the primary body's equatorial axis indicates that tidally induced ground motion generated by a binary asteroid system is detectable by modern seismometers, like the instruments deployed on the InSight mission to Mars. Owing to the relatively short orbital period of the satellite - a mean of 25.8 h for known binary NEAs - only a modest mission lifetime would be required for a seismometer to adequately characterize an asteroid's interior through tidally induced deformation. Future deployment of seismometers on binary asteroids will allow for a detailed characterization of the structure of these objects.",

The science objective of the mission is to investigate how space weathering processes affect the surfaces of airless planetary bodies by monitoring the spectral reflectance properties of geological samples over time. Two three-color cameras acquire spectral reflectance data within the visible spectrum to measure any spectral and/or textural changes exhibited throughout the ∼1-year orbital mission. This mission will provide valuable data to help understand how the space environment may affect the surfaces of the Moon, Mercury, and main-belt and near-Earth asteroids. The acquired data will help constrain meteorite-asteroid links and provide insight into the spectroscopic analysis of samples returned from the Moon, and near-Earth asteroids Itokawa, Bennu, and Ryugu. The results of this mission will also complement the results of laboratory simulations of space weathering.

We computed the minimum orbital intersecting distance (MOID) of the dust particles as the realistic condition, that is, the Earth's radius and the Earth-Moon distance to be observed as the Geminid meteoroid stream. <BR /> Results: We found that the low-velocity ejection model produced the Geminid-like meteoroid stream when the dust particles were ejected more than ~2000 yr ago. In this case, close encounters with terrestrial planets would transport some dust particles from the Phaethon orbit (the current MOID is as large as ~460 Earth radii) to the Earth-intersecting orbits. The optimal ejection epoch and the estimated mass were 18 000 yr ago and ~10<SUP>10</SUP>-10<SUP>14</SUP> g (&lt;0.1% of the Phaethon mass). <BR /> Conclusions: Our results suggest that the JAXA DESTINY<SUP>+</SUP> mission has the potential to find evidence of recent rotational instability recorded on the surface of Phaethon.",

      "abstract": "Carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) are windows into the early Solar System and the histories of their parent bodies. Their infrared spectral signatures are powerful proxies for deciphering their composition and evolution history, but still present formidable challenges in relation to determining the degree of secondary processing such as aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism via comprehensive data and mid-infrared feature. In our study, we delved into the infrared spectra spanning 1-25 μm of 17 CCs, with distinct petrological characteristics and varying degrees of alteration. Through this investigation, we uncovered distinct spectral patterns that shed light on the processes of alteration and metamorphism. As aqueous alteration intensifies, two key spectral features, the 3 μm-region absorption feature associated with OH-bearing minerals and water, and the 6 μm band indicative of water molecules, both grow in intensity. Simultaneously, their band centers shift towards shorter wavelengths. Moreover, as alteration progresses, a distinctive absorption feature emerges near 2.72 μm, resembling the OH absorption feature found in serpentine and saponite minerals. Comparison of aqueous alteration to laboratory-heated CCs suggests that the 3 μm region OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O absorption feature differs between CC heated to less than or more than ∼300 °C. Further insights are gained by examining the vibrational features of silicate minerals, notably influencing the 10 μm and 20 μm regions. The 12.4 μm /11.4 μm reflectance ratio diminishes, and the reflectance peak in the 9-14 μm range shifts towards shorter wavelengths. These changes are attributed to the transformation of anhydrous silicates into phyllosilicates. In the 15-25 μm region, the influence of thermal metamorphism becomes evident and results in the appearance of more spectral features, the single reflectance peak at 22.1 μm undergoes a transformation into two distinct peaks at 19 μm and 25 μm, which is primarily attributed to the increased presence of anhydrous silicates and olivine recrystallization. These findings offer novel insights into the volatile-rich compositions of C-complex asteroids and the thermal evolution histories of their parent bodies.",

In this work, we studied the orbital evolution of a swarm of boulders with a similar size to that of the detected ones. By using recent estimates for the ejection velocity of the boulders, we numerically propagated the dynamics of the swarm for 20 kyr in the future. We found that the ejection velocities and the non-gravitational effects are not strong enough to change the secular evolution significantly. The minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with the Earth will be reached in about 2.5 kyr, but it will not fall below 0.02 au. On the contrary, the Mars MOID will be very small in four instances, two near 6 kyr and the other two near 15 kyr. Therefore, there may be a chance for them to impact Mars in the future. Given the rarefaction of the Martian atmosphere, we expect the boulders to arrive intact on the ground and excavate a small impact crater. The results presented here provide a further indication that some meteorites found on Earth originated in collisions of ~100 m near-Earth asteroids with projectiles of ~1 m in size.",

Though the statistical chance of such a collision is minuscule, the high risk associated with Apophis motivates us to examine even this very unlikely scenario. In this work, we identify encounters between known asteroids and Apophis up to 2029 April. Here we show that Apophis will encounter the 1300 m diameter asteroid 4544 Xanthus in 2026 December. Their minimum orbit intersection distance is less than 10,000 km, with Apophis passing that closest point just 4 hr before Xanthus. Though a direct collision is ruled out, the encounter is close enough that material accompanying Xanthus (if any) could strike Apophis. We also identify other asteroid encounters that deserve monitoring.",

To understand the feasible initial condition of the flexible probe's horizontal landing trajectory under multiple constraints, a controllable cone is defined and investigated. The boundary of the controllable cone is calculated using a double-layer optimization method. In the inner-layer, the switching time of the thrust profile is fixed, and the boundary point is solved through a multi-constraint trajectory optimization problem that considers the influence caused by the flexible deformation. In the outer-layer, the switching time of the thrust profile is optimized to maximize the cone boundary. To improve the optimization efficiency, an adaptive interval is used to search the switching time. With the double-layer optimization method, the controllable cone boundaries can be generated for both a specific height and a three-dimensional space. The controllable cone of the flexible probe is simulated for the landing on asteroid 433 Eros, and the influence of the flexible deformation is also analyzed.",

      "abstract": "Volatile compositions of asteroids provide information on the Solar System history and the origins of Earth's volatiles. Visible to near-infrared observations at wavelengths of &lt;2.5 µm have suggested a genetic link between outer main belt asteroids located at 2.5-4 au and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites (CCs) that show isotopic similarities to volatile elements on Earth. However, recent longer wavelength data for large outer main belt asteroids show 3.1 μm absorption features of ammoniated phyllosilicates that are absent in CCs and cannot easily form from materials stable at those present distances. Here, by combining data collected by the AKARI space telescope and hydrological, geochemical, and spectral models of water-rock reactions, we show that the surface materials of asteroids having 3.1 μm absorption features and CCs can originate from different regions of a single, water-rock-differentiated parent body. Ammoniated phyllosilicates form within the water-rich mantles of the differentiated bodies containing NH<SUB>3</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB> under high water-rock ratios (&gt;4) and low temperatures (&lt;70°C). CCs can originate from the rock-dominated cores, that are likely to be preferentially sampled as meteorites by disruption and transport processes. Our results suggest that multiple large main belt asteroids formed beyond the NH<SUB>3</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB> snow lines (currently &gt;10 au) and could be transported to their current locations. Earth's high hydrogen to carbon ratio may be explained by accretion of these water-rich progenitors.",

We also report a survey-quality spectrum for main-belt asteroid (52246) Donaldjohanson. We measured a continuum of spectral slopes including “red” (Orus, Leucus), “less red” (Eurybates, Patroclus-Menoetius), and intermediate (Polymele), indicating a range of compositional end-members or geological histories. We perform radiative transfer modeling of several possible surface compositions. We find that the mild-sloped spectra and low albedo of Patroclus and Eurybates imply similar compositions. Eurybates (∼7 wt.% water ice) and Patroclus (∼4 wt.% water ice) are consistent with a hydrated surface. Models for Orus and Leucus are consistent with each other and require a significantly more reddening agent (e.g., iron-rich silicates or tholin-like organics). Polymele has a linear spectrum like Patroclus, but a higher albedo more closely aligned with Orus/Leucus, defying simple grouping. Solar system formation models generally predict that the Jovian Trojans accreted in the outer solar system. Our observations and analysis are generally consistently with this expectation, although not uniquely so.",

      "abstract": "This thesis investigates connections between low albedo asteroids and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites using spectroscopy. Meteorites and asteroids preserve information about the early solar system including accretion processes and parent body processes active on asteroids at these early times. One process of interest is aqueous alteration. This is the chemical reaction between coaccreted water and silicates producing hydrated minerals. Some carbonaceous chondrites have experienced extensive interactions with water through this process. Since these meteorites and their parent bodies formed close to the beginning of the Solar System, these asteroids and meteorites may provide clues to the distribution, abundance and timing of water in the Solar nebula at these times. Chapter 2 of this thesis investigates the relationships between extensively aqueously altered meteorites and their visible, near and mid-infrared spectral features in a coordinated spectral-mineralogical study. Aqueous alteration is a parent body process where initially accreted anhydrous minerals are converted into hydrated minerals in the presence of coaccreted water. Using samples of meteorites with known bulk properties, it is possible to directly connect changes in mineralogy caused by aqueous alteration with spectral features. Spectral features in the mid-infrared are found to change continuously with increasing amount of hydrated minerals or degree of alteration. Building on this result, the degrees of alteration of asteroids are estimated in a survey of new asteroid data obtained from SOFIA and IRTF as well as archived the Spitzer Space Telescope data. 75 observations of 73 asteroids are analyzed and presented in Chapter 4. Asteroids with hydrated minerals are found throughout the main belt indicating that significant ice must have been present in the disk at the time of carbonaceous asteroid accretion. Finally, some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites preserve amorphous iron-bearing materials that formed through disequilibrium condensation in the disk. These materials are readily destroyed in parent body processes so their presence indicates the meteorite/asteroid has undergone minimal parent body processes since the time of accretion. Presented in Chapter 3 is the spectral signature of meteorites that preserve significant amorphous iron-bearing materials and the identification of an asteroid, (93) Minerva, that also appears to preserve these materials.",

This quadrangle is notable for the broad, spectrally distinct ejecta that extend south of the Oppia crater. These ejecta exhibit the steepest ('reddest') visible spectral slope observed across the asteroid and have distinct color properties as seen in multispectral composite images. Compared to previous works that focused on the composition and nature of unusual ('orange') ejecta found on Vesta, here we take into account a broader area that includes several features of interest, with an emphasis on mineralogy as inferred from data obtained by Dawn's Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer (VIR). Our analysis shows that the older northern and northeastern part of Av-10 is dominated by howardite-like material, while the younger southwestern part, including Oppia and its ejecta blanket, has a markedly eucritic mineralogy. The association of the mineralogical information with the geologic and topographic contexts allows for the establishment of relationships between the age of the main formations observed in this quadrangle and their composition. A major point of interest in the Oppia quadrangle is the spectral signature of hydrous material seen at the local scale. This material can be mapped by using high-resolution VIR data, combined with multispectral image products from the Dawn Framing Camera (FC) so as to enable a clear correlation with specific geologic features. Hydrated mineral phases studied previously on Vesta generally correlate with low-albedo material delivered by carbonaceous asteroids. However, our analysis shows that the strongest OH signature in Av-10 is found in a unit west of Oppia, previously mapped as 'light mantle material' and showing moderate reflectance and a red visible slope. With the available data we cannot yet assess the presence of water in this material. However, we offer a possible explanation for its origin.",

We obtained 2-4-μm spectroscopy of (90) Antiope in 2006 and 2008, and we find an absorption in the 3-μm region clearly present in our 2008 spectrum and likely in our 2006 spectrum. Both spectra have rounded, bowl-shaped absorptions consistent with those ascribed to water ice as in the spectrum of Asteroid (24) Themis. We also present and compare Spitzer 8-12-μm mid-infrared spectra of (24) Themis and (90) Antiope. We find that (90) Antiope is lacking a \"fairy castle\" dusty surface, which is in contrast to (24) Themis, other Themis family members (Licandro, J. et al. [2012]. Astron.

Planet. Sci. 39(1), 3-16), we are able for the first time to directly correlate mineralogy with features in reflectance spectra. At visible/near-infrared wavelength, the presence of a 0.7-μm charge transfer band is indicative of aqueous alteration. However, not all altered CM/CI meteorites exhibit this feature; thus the lack of a 0.7 μm absorption band in asteroids does not necessarily signify a lack of aqueous alteration. Furthermore, the position and depth of 0.7-μm charge transfer band shows no correlation with the mineralogical changes associated with aqueous alteration. Similarly, the near-infrared slope, which is not directly related to the mineralogic progression associated with increasing alteration, is not unambiguously related to degree of alteration in the CM/CI meteorites studied. However, the mid-infrared reflectance spectra of CM/CI meteorites contain a broad absorption feature in the 10-13-μm region, which is a convolution of vibrational features due to Mg-rich phyllosilicates and unaltered olivine. The overall feature continuously changes with total phyllosilicate abundance from a shorter wavenumber/longer wavelength peak (815 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, 12.3-μm) for less altered meteorites to a longer wavenumber/shorter wavelength (875 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, 11.4-μm) peak in the highly altered meteorites, with roughly equal spectral contributions producing a doublet in intermediately altered meteorites, Using the results from the mid-infrared analyses of meteorite spectra, it is possible to estimate the degree of alteration on dark primitive asteroids. We find Asteroid (24) Themis to have a 1000-700 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (10-13-μm) peak at longer wavelengths suggesting Themis has a complex surface mineralogy with approximately 70 vol.% phyllosilicates and 25 vol.% anhydrous silicates.",

However, a few outer-belt asteroids having high albedos are known, suggesting the presence of unusually reflective surface minerals or, conceivably, even exposed water ice. Here, we present near-infrared (1.1-2.5 μm) spectra of four outer-belt C-complex asteroids with albedos &gt;=0.1. We find no absorption features characteristic of water ice (near 1.5 and 2.0 μm) in the objects. Intimate mixture models set limits to the water ice by weight &lt;=2%. Asteroids (723) Hammonia and (936) Kunigunde are featureless and have (60%-95%) amorphous Mg pyroxenes that might explain the high albedos. Asteroid (1276) Ucclia also shows a featureless reflection spectrum with (50%-60%) amorphous Mg pyroxenes. Asteroid (1576) Fabiola shows a possible weak, broad absorption band (1.5-2.1 μm). The feature can be reproduced by (80%) amorphous Mg pyroxenes or orthopyroxene (crystalline silicate), either of which is likely to cause its high albedo. We discuss the origin of high-albedo components in primitive asteroids.",

      "abstract": "Context. The Themis collisional family is one of the largest and best established families in the main belt. Composed of primitive asteroids, there is evidence that water is likely present in a large fraction of its members, either in aqueously altered silicates or in water ice reservoirs. The study of the abundance of water in the outer asteroid belt is important as it may be linked to the origin of Earth's water. Studying the Themis family can also help to constrain the compositional and thermal environment in the region of the solar nebula where these asteroids formed. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to constrain the composition and thermal properties of the surfaces of several Themis family asteroids. <BR /> Methods: We present 5-14 μm spectra of 8 Themis family asteroids observed with Spitzer: (222) Lucia, (223) Rosa, (316) Goberta, (383) Janina, (468) Lina, (492) Gismonda, (515) Athalia, and (526) Jena. We determine their diameters, geometric albedos and beaming parameters using the near-Earth asteroid thermal model. Their emissivity spectra are studied in order to determine if they exhibit an emission plateau from 9 to 12 μm which has been observed in other primitive asteroids and attributed to fine-grained silicates (the Si-O stretch fundamental). <BR /> Results: The derived mean albedo of our sample of Themis family asteroids is bar p<SUB>V = 0.07 ± 0.02</SUB> = 0.07 ± 0.02, and the mean beaming parameter is bar η = 1.05 ± 0.10. The derived bar η value is close to unity, which implies that the infrared beaming is not significant, there is likely little night-side emission from the asteroids, and the thermal inertia is probably low. The emissivity spectra of at least 5 of our 8 asteroids show a 9-12 μm emission plateau with spectral contrast of 2-4%, similar but smaller than that observed in the spectra of Trojan asteroids and cometary dust. The plateau may be due to the surfaces having either small silicate grains embedded in a relatively transparent matrix, or from a very under-dense (fairy-castle) surface structure. <BR /> Conclusions: The surfaces of a large fraction of Themis family asteroids with D 50 km are covered by a fine grained silicate mantle as observed on Trojan asteroids of similar or larger size. The lower amplitude of the silicate emission in Themis family asteroids spectra (2-4%) with respect to that of Trojan asteroids (10-15%) could be attributed to larger dust particles, a slightly denser structure, or a lower silicate dust fraction.",

We used the IRCS spectrograph on the 8 m Subaru telescope to obtain medium-resolution spectra of Scheila in the HK band (1.4-2.5 μm) and low-resolution spectra in the KL band (2.0-4.0 μm) on UT 2010 December 13 and 14. In addition, we obtained low-resolution spectroscopy using the SpeX spectrograph on the 3 m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2011 January 4 and 5. The spectrum of Scheila shows a consistent red slope from 0.8 to 4.0 μm with no apparent absorption features, resembling spectra of D-type asteroids. An intimate mixing model suggests that the amount of water ice that might be present on the surface of Scheila is no more than a few percent. The spectrum of the Tagish Lake chondrite matches the asteroid's spectrum at shorter wavelengths (λ &lt; 2.5 μm), but no hydration features are observed at longer wavelengths on Scheila. Our analysis corroborates other studies suggesting that the comet-like activity of Scheila is likely not caused by the sublimation of water ice. The dust coma and tail may be results of a recent impact event.",

      "abstract": "IR spectroscopy is one of the few techniques that can directly probe water molecules in rocks. This method has been used to characterize the mineralogy of hydrated/hydrous carbonaceous chondrites, and to link known meteorite families with spectroscopic observations of low albedo asteroids. In this paper, we present measurements of the infrared transmission spectra of matrix chunks from 3 CI and 9 CM chondrites. Spectra were measured at ambient conditions and then at different temperatures along a dehydration path toward high- T (∼300 °C) under primary vacuum. At ambient conditions, the 3-μm spectral range is always dominated by adsorbed atmospheric water molecules. Upon moderate (∼100 °C) and high (∼300 °C) heating under low pressure ( P &lt; 10 <SUP>-4</SUP> mbar), adsorbed water and then phyllosilicates interlayer water are removed, revealing a residual absorption band around 3 μm. This band is a characteristic IR feature of the phyllosilicate phases which dominate the mineralogical assemblage of hydrated carbonaceous chondrites. Among the CM chondrites, the high- T spectra reveal a strong variability that appears correlated with the alteration classification scheme of Rubin et al. (2007) and Howard et al. (2009a). The 3-μm band continuously evolves from a broad feature peaking at 3550-3600 cm <SUP>-1</SUP> for the weakly altered CMs (Murchison-type) to a sharp asymmetric peak at ∼3675 cm <SUP>-1</SUP> for the more extensively altered samples (Cold Bokkeveld-type). We attribute this spectral evolution to variations in the chemistry of the phyllosilicate phases from Fe-rich to Mg-rich. On the other hand, the 10-μm spectral region shows a single broad peak which does not compare with known terrestrial serpentine spectra, probably due to high structural disorder of the chondrite phyllosilicate phases. The present work clearly shows that previously published reflectance spectra of chondrites are biased by the presence of adsorbed terrestrial water molecules. Laboratory data collected under dry conditions are needed to reinterpret the chondrite-asteroid connection from the comparison of their 3-μm absorption features.",

Our spectrum is compared with those of meteorite samples and man-made mineral mixtures to determine possible components, modeled using multiple scattering formulations, and also compared with the spectra of comet nuclei and other comet-asteroid transitional objects. <BR />Results: Phaethon's spectrum does not show any sharp structure and has a negative slope at wavelengths &gt;0.43 μm, consistent with B-type asteroids. Below 0.43 μm the reflectance decreases. The spectral shape is similar to that of aqueously altered CI/CM meteorites and of hydrated minerals. A surface composition with hydrated silicates is also suggested by the models. A possible spectral variability in the UV is suggested by the avaliable spectra, and is compatible with a slightly different abundance of hydrated silicates. Finally, Phaethon's spectrum shows important differences with the few comet nuclei properly observed at these wavelengths and is similar to the spectra of other peculiar comet-asteroid transition objects. <BR />Conclusions: .The spectral properties and dynamical properties of (3200) Phaethon support an asteroidal nature rather than a cometary one.

Using this relationship, an empirical algorithm for predicting the presence of water of hydration in the surface material of a Solar System body using photometry obtained through the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey v (0.550 μm), w (0.701 μm), and x (0.853 μm) filters was developed and applied to the ECAS photometry of asteroids and outer planet satellites. The percentage of objects in low-albedo, outer main-belt asteroid classes that test positively for water of hydration increases from P → B → C → G class and correlates linearly with the increasing mean albedos of those objects testing positively. The aqueous alteration sequence in the Solar System thus ranges from P-class asteroids, which represent the least-altered objects created at temperatures attained at the onset of aqueous alteration, to G-class asteroids, which represent the upper range of the alteration sequence. The medium-albedo M-class asteroids do not test positively in large number using this algorithm. These objects could represent a mixture of metals with phyllosilicates that have been significantly altered to the extent that iron has been leached out of the phyllosilicates and sequestered in opaque phases such as magnetite or iron sulfides. Spatial variation in the presence of water of hydration across the surface of some asteroids is suggested in the variability of the water of hydration test for observations of many asteroids on different nights, although an effort to correlate variation with rotational period is unsuccessful due to the small sample of eligible asteroids. Aqueously altered asteroids dominate the Solar System population between heliocentric distances of 2.6 to 3.5 AU, bracketing the Solar System region where the aqueous alteration mechanism operated most strongly. One jovian satellite, J VI Himalia, and one saturnian satellite. Phoebe, tested positively for water of hydration, supporting the hypothesis that these may be captured C-class asteroids from a postaccretional dispersion. The proposed testing technique could be applied to an Earth-based survey of asteroids or a space-probe study of an asteroid's surface characteristics in order to identify a potential water source.",

Powdered samples were used as analogues of asteroidal regoliths. These spectra show that most powdered meteorite samples have undergone alteration, even if only exposed to water vapor in the air, and many have been contaminated by volatile hydrocarbons characterized by absorption bands near 3.45 μm. In contrast, primary macromolecular hydrocarbons do not display the 3.45-μm bands, or, in fact, any other detectable spectral features in these reflectance spectra. However, powdered meteorites display a wide variety of other spectral features that can be used for their identification. These include residual reststrahlen features, which occur as reflectance peaks, absorption bands due to overtone/combination tone bands, which occur as reflectance troughs, and the Christiansen feature, which also occurs as a trough in reflectance. The most prominent reststrahlen peaks are those of olivine and pyroxene, and the wavelength position of the olivine features is sensitive to the Mg/Fe ratio. Olivine and pyroxene also show strong overtone/combination tone absorption bands that shift position with the Mg/Fe ratio, and calcite can be identified in the spectra of some carbonaceous chondrites from such overtone/combination tone bands. These spectral features can be used independently to help determine mineralogy and meteorite type, but using the entire spectrum in a digital search library is preferred for successfull identification. The spectral effect of the vacuum environment should be relatively small for meteorites compared to that found in previous work for granites, but confident interpretation of the spectra of asteroids will require a better understanding of the effects of the space environment on meteorite spectra and of the spectral mixing model for meteorite minerals.",

The model predicts surface and subsurface temperatures, water fluxes, and ice depths as well as integrated water supply rates and residual atmospheric/surface water as a function of time, lattitude, and assumed regolith properties. We find that ice could have survived for 4.5 byr at depths of only 10-100 m near the equator and less than 1.0 to 10 m at latitudes greater than 40°. The current global water supply rate is expected to be between 30 and 300 g sec <SUP>-1</SUP>, which corresponds to a near surface number density of ∼1 × 10 <SUP>4</SUP>molecules cm <SUP>-3</SUP>. At least one current interpretation of the near-infrared reflectance of Ceres requires coverage by a very thin layer of ice down to 48° lat. Our model suggests that ice with the overall albedo of Ceres (0.09) could exist in transient steady state with the above supply rate only at latitudes greater than 80°. Otherwise the water loss rate from Ceres would exceed the supply rate by orders of magnitude. Stirring of the regolith substantially alters the distribution of ice only at latitudes greater than 70°. At lower latitudes ice depletion is faster than impact rehomogenization at all relevant depths and time scales. Possible contributors to the spectral feature at 3.1 μm other than free surface ice, such as interlayer ice within the optical surface, are considered.",

      "abstract": "This study consisted of a comprehensive laboratory and telescopic investigation of H_2O distribution among the low-albedo, outer belt asteroids (2.5-5.2 AU). The water distribution was determined by surveying asteroids for the 3-μm molecular H_2O and structural OH ion absorption, the spectral signature of meteorite and asteroid hydrated silicates. Survey results were interpreted using the mid-infrared (2.5-25 μm) reflectance spectra of 16 carbonaceous chondrites and other likely asteroidal materials. The 19 asteroids observed in this program, augmented by earlier reflectance data, yielded 3-μm band depth measurements that reflect the present outer belt H_2 O distribution. Of the 32 C-class asteroids in this sample, 66% have hydrated silicate surfaces, indicating a mild aqueous alteration episode early in solar system history. Strictly speaking, the C class is thus not a primitive asteroid group, but the anhydrous objects appear little altered, as do the P and D asteroid classes beyond 3.5 AU. In addition to this pronounced difference in hydration state among the outer belt classes, the C region shows a gradual decline in hydrated silicate abundance from 2.5 to 3.5 AU. This trend, coupled with the apparently anhydrous P and D surfaces, is consistent with an original outer belt asteroid composition of anhydrous silicates, water ice, and complex organic material. Early solar wind induction heating of proto-asteroids declined in intensity with heliocentric distance, and produced the observed radial decrease in hydrated silicate abundance. The mild thermal processing of the outer belt is a continuation of the intense heating and differentiation episode that occurred sunward of 2.5 AU, and both events support the induction heating mechanism. The larger outer belt inventory of volatile-rich objects may have been a significant contributor to the atmospheres of the terrestrial planets.",

The other 5 asteroids have no 3-μm absorption greater than 2% in intensity. The strength of the \"water\" feature in the spectra correlates positively with the strength of the UV absorption feature shortward of 0.4 μm, and negatively with the slope of the continuum between 1.2 and 2.2 μm. These correlations are the same as those seen in laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites, whose silicate compositions range from hydrated phyllosilicates to anhydrous olivine. We find no correlation between composition and semimajor axis for C asteroids as a class. The present C-asteroid population may be fragments of larger parent bodies with anhydrous C3-like cores and hydrated C11- or C2M-like mantles.",

It is concluded that the spectrum of Ceres shows a strong absorption at 2.7-2.8 μm due to structural OH groups in clay minerals. The dominant minerals on the surface of Ceres are therefore hydrated clay minerals structurally similar to terrestrial montmorillonites.

However, existing methods cannot leverage coarse labels to infer fine-grained labels in an unsupervised manner. To bridge this gap, we propose FALCON, a method that discovers fine-grained classes from coarsely labeled data without any supervision at the fine-grained level. FALCON simultaneously infers unknown fine-grained classes and underlying relationships between coarse and fine-grained classes. Moreover, FALCON is a modular method that can effectively learn from multiple datasets labeled with different strategies. We evaluate FALCON on eight image classification tasks and a single-cell classification task. FALCON outperforms baselines by a large margin, achieving 22% improvement over the best baseline on the tieredImageNet dataset with over 600 fine-grained classes.",

Previous training methods focus on aligning query samples with positive samples and distancing them from negatives. They often neglect intra-category and inter-category semantic similarities of fine-grained categories when navigating sample distributions in the embedding space. Furthermore, some evaluation techniques that rely on pre-collected test samples are inadequate for real-time applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a method that successfully detects fine-grained clusters of semantically similar texts guided by a novel objective function. The method uses semantic similarities in a logarithmic space to guide sample distributions in the Euclidean space and to form distinct clusters that represent fine-grained categories. We also propose a centroid inference mechanism to support real-time applications. The efficacy of the method is both theoretically justified and empirically confirmed on three benchmark tasks. The proposed objective function is integrated in multiple contrastive learning based neural models. Its results surpass existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Accuracy, Adjusted Rand Index and Normalized Mutual Information of the detected fine-grained categories.

Compared to traditional fine-grained visual categorization, Ultra-FGVC encounters more hurdles due to the small inter-class and large intra-class variation. Given these challenges, relying on human annotation for Ultra-FGVC is impractical. To this end, our work introduces a novel task termed Ultra-Fine-Grained Novel Class Discovery (UFG-NCD), which leverages partially annotated data to identify new categories of unlabeled images for Ultra-FGVC. To tackle this problem, we devise a Region-Aligned Proxy Learning (RAPL) framework, which comprises a Channel-wise Region Alignment (CRA) module and a Semi-Supervised Proxy Learning (SemiPL) strategy. The CRA module is designed to extract and utilize discriminative features from local regions, facilitating knowledge transfer from labeled to unlabeled classes. Furthermore, SemiPL strengthens representation learning and knowledge transfer with proxy-guided supervised learning and proxy-guided contrastive learning. Such techniques leverage class distribution information in the embedding space, improving the mining of subtle differences between labeled and unlabeled ultra-fine-grained classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPL significantly outperforms baselines across various datasets, indicating its effectiveness in handling the challenges of UFG-NCD.

Meanwhile, novel, impactful research often stems from both a deep understanding of prior work, and a cross-pollination of ideas across domains and fields. To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents. Specifically, starting with a core scientific paper, ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications by connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from a knowledge store derived from shared underlying concepts mined across numerous papers. Then, mimicking a scientific approach to improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple LLM-based ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback via iterative revision processes. These reviewing agents are instantiated with human preference-aligned LLMs whose criteria for evaluation are elicited from actual human judgments via LLM prompting. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid ideas based on both human and model-based evaluation results. Our initial foray into AI-mediated scientific research has important implications for the development of future systems aimed at supporting researchers in their ideation and operationalization of novel work.",

      "abstract": "Hierarchical text classification aims to categorize each document into a set of classes in a label taxonomy, which is a fundamental web text mining task with broad applications such as web content analysis and semantic indexing. Most earlier works focus on fully or semi-supervised methods that require a large amount of human annotated data which is costly and time-consuming to acquire. To alleviate human efforts, in this paper, we work on hierarchical text classification with a minimal amount of supervision: using the sole class name of each node as the only supervision. Recently, large language models (LLM) have shown competitive performance on various tasks through zero-shot prompting, but this method performs poorly in the hierarchical setting because it is ineffective to include the large and structured label space in a prompt. On the other hand, previous weakly-supervised hierarchical text classification methods only utilize the raw taxonomy skeleton and ignore the rich information hidden in the text corpus that can serve as additional class-indicative features. To tackle the above challenges, we propose TELEClass, Taxonomy Enrichment and LLM-Enhanced weakly-supervised hierarchical text Classification, which combines the general knowledge of LLMs and task-specific features mined from an unlabeled corpus. TELEClass automatically enriches the raw taxonomy with class-indicative features for better label space understanding and utilizes novel LLM-based data annotation and generation methods specifically tailored for the hierarchical setting. Experiments show that TELEClass can significantly outperform previous baselines while achieving comparable performance to zero-shot prompting of LLMs with drastically less inference cost.",

      "abstract": "Entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction are three representative tasks that can be applied to automatically populate an existing taxonomy with emerging concepts. Previous studies view them as three separate tasks. Therefore, their proposed techniques usually work for one specific task only, lacking generalizability and a holistic perspective. In this paper, we aim at a unified solution to the three tasks. To be specific, we identify two common skills needed for entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction: finding \"siblings\" and finding \"parents\". We propose a taxonomy-guided instruction tuning framework to teach a large language model to generate siblings and parents for query entities, where the joint pre-training process facilitates the mutual enhancement of the two skills. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed TaxoInstruct framework, which outperforms task-specific baselines across all three tasks.",

      "abstract": "Accurately typing entity mentions from text segments is a fundamental task for various natural language processing applications. Many previous approaches rely on massive human-annotated data to perform entity typing. Nevertheless, collecting such data in highly specialized science and engineering domains (e.g., software engineering and security) can be time-consuming and costly, without mentioning the domain gaps between training and inference data if the model needs to be applied to confidential datasets. In this paper, we study the task of seed-guided fine-grained entity typing in science and engineering domains, which takes the name and a few seed entities for each entity type as the only supervision and aims to classify new entity mentions into both seen and unseen types (i.e., those without seed entities). To solve this problem, we propose SEType which first enriches the weak supervision by finding more entities for each seen type from an unlabeled corpus using the contextualized representations of pre-trained language models. It then matches the enriched entities to unlabeled text to get pseudo-labeled samples and trains a textual entailment model that can make inferences for both seen and unseen types. Extensive experiments on two datasets covering four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of SEType in comparison with various baselines.",

We leverage proprietary LLMs to generate diverse synthetic data for hundreds of thousands of text embedding tasks across 93 languages. We then fine-tune open-source decoder-only LLMs on the synthetic data using standard contrastive loss.

Conventional methods for FET require extensive human annotation, which is time-consuming and costly. Recent studies have been developing weakly supervised or zero-shot approaches. We study the setting of zero-shot FET where only an ontology is provided. However, most existing ontology structures lack rich supporting information and even contain ambiguous relations, making them ineffective in guiding FET. Recently developed language models, though promising in various few-shot and zero-shot NLP tasks, may face challenges in zero-shot FET due to their lack of interaction with task-specific ontology. In this study, we propose OnEFET, where we (1) enrich each node in the ontology structure with two types of extra information: instance information for training sample augmentation and topic information to relate types to contexts, and (2) develop a coarse-to-fine typing algorithm that exploits the enriched information by training an entailment model with contrasting topics and instance-based augmented training samples. Our experiments show that OnEFET achieves high-quality fine-grained entity typing without human annotation, outperforming existing zero-shot methods by a large margin and rivaling supervised methods.",

Previous efforts in this area have considered various factors to assess the relevance of a reviewer's expertise to a paper, such as the semantic similarity, shared topics, and citation connections between the paper and the reviewer's previous works. However, most of these studies focus on only one factor, resulting in an incomplete evaluation of the paper-reviewer relevance. To address this issue, we propose a unified model for paper-reviewer matching that jointly considers semantic, topic, and citation factors. To be specific, during training, we instruction-tune a contextualized language model shared across all factors to capture their commonalities and characteristics; during inference, we chain the three factors to enable step-by-step, coarse-to-fine search for qualified reviewers given a submission.

Existing studies on weakly supervised paper classification are less concerned with two challenges: (1) Papers should be classified into not only coarse-grained research topics but also fine-grained themes, and potentially into multiple themes, given a large and fine-grained label space; and (2) full text should be utilized to complement the paper title and abstract for classification. Moreover, instead of viewing the entire paper as a long linear sequence, one should exploit the structural information such as citation links across papers and the hierarchy of sections and paragraphs in each paper. To tackle these challenges, in this study, we propose FUTEX, a framework that uses the cross-paper network structure and the in-paper hierarchy structure to classify full-text scientific papers under weak supervision. A network-aware contrastive fine-tuning module and a hierarchy-aware aggregation module are designed to leverage the two types of structural signals, respectively. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FUTEX significantly outperforms competitive baselines and is on par with fully supervised classifiers that use 1,000 to 60,000 ground-truth training samples.",

Existing dual-encoder methods in HTC achieve weak performance gains with huge memory overheads and their structure encoders heavily rely on domain knowledge. Under such observation, we tend to investigate the feasibility of a memory-friendly model with strong generalization capability that could boost the performance of HTC without prior statistics or label semantics. In this paper, we propose Hierarchy-aware Tree Isomorphism Network (HiTIN) to enhance the text representations with only syntactic information of the label hierarchy. Specifically, we convert the label hierarchy into an unweighted tree structure, termed coding tree, with the guidance of structural entropy. Then we design a structure encoder to incorporate hierarchy-aware information in the coding tree into text representations. Besides the text encoder, HiTIN only contains a few multi-layer perceptions and linear transformations, which greatly saves memory. We conduct experiments on three commonly used datasets and the results demonstrate that HiTIN could achieve better test performance and less memory consumption than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

Most existing methods first use the label names as static keyword-based features to generate pseudo labels, which are then used for final classifier training. While reasonable, such a commonly adopted framework suffers from two limitations: (1) keywords can have different meanings in different contexts and some text may not have any keyword, so keyword matching can induce noisy and inadequate pseudo labels; (2) the errors made in the pseudo label generation stage will directly propagate to the classifier training stage without a chance of being corrected. In this paper, we propose a new method, PIEClass, consisting of two modules: (1) a pseudo label acquisition module that uses zero-shot prompting of pre-trained language models (PLM) to get pseudo labels based on contextualized text understanding beyond static keyword matching, and (2) a noise-robust iterative ensemble training module that iteratively trains classifiers and updates pseudo labels by utilizing two PLM fine-tuning methods that regularize each other. Extensive experiments show that PIEClass achieves overall better performance than existing strong baselines on seven benchmark datasets and even achieves similar performance to fully-supervised classifiers on sentiment classification tasks.",

Scientific literature tagging is beyond a pure multi-label text classification task because papers on the Web are prevalently accompanied by metadata information such as venues, authors, and references, which may serve as additional signals to infer relevant tags. Although there have been studies making use of metadata in academic paper classification, their focus is often restricted to one or two scientific fields (e.g., computer science and biomedicine) and to one specific model. In this work, we systematically study the effect of metadata on scientific literature tagging across 19 fields. We select three representative multi-label classifiers (i.e., a bag-of-words model, a sequence-based model, and a pre-trained language model) and explore their performance change in scientific literature tagging when metadata are fed to the classifiers as additional features. We observe some ubiquitous patterns of metadata's effects across all fields (e.g., venues are consistently beneficial to paper tagging in almost all cases), as well as some unique patterns in fields other than computer science and biomedicine, which are not explored in previous studies.",

Existing methods either ignore references or utilize only abstracts indiscriminately from them, failing to tackle the challenge mentioned above. To fill that gap, we propose a novel citation-aware scientific paper summarization framework based on citation graphs, able to accurately locate and incorporate the salient contents from references, as well as capture varying relevance between source papers and their references. Specifically, we first build a domain-specific dataset PubMedCite with about 192K biomedical scientific papers and a large citation graph preserving 917K citation relationships between them. It is characterized by preserving the salient contents extracted from full texts of references, and the weighted correlation between the salient contents of references and the source paper. Based on it, we design a self-supervised citation-aware summarization framework (CitationSum) with graph contrastive learning, which boosts the summarization generation by efficiently fusing the salient information in references with source paper contents under the guidance of their correlations.

To accommodate such requirements, we introduce a new problem called coarse-to-fine grained classification, which aims to perform fine-grained classification on coarsely annotated data. Instead of asking for new fine-grained human annotations, we opt to leverage label surface names as the only human guidance and weave in rich pre-trained generative language models into the iterative weak supervision strategy. Specifically, we first propose a label-conditioned finetuning formulation to attune these generators for our task. Furthermore, we devise a regularization objective based on the coarse-fine label constraints derived from our problem setting, giving us even further improvements over the prior formulation. Our framework uses the fine-tuned generative models to sample pseudo-training data for training the classifier, and bootstraps on real unlabeled data for model refinement. Extensive experiments and case studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance over SOTA zero-shot classification baselines.",

      "abstract": "<BR /> Aims: The primary objective of this study is to utilize Gaia DR3 asteroid astrometry to detect the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational acceleration that affects the orbits of small asteroids. We then computed the bulk densities for the sample of objects for which we obtained an estimation of the Yarkovsky effect. <BR /> Methods: We used the version of the OrbFit software that is currently developed at the Minor Planet Center (MPC). We utilized the complete astrometric dataset from the MPC, encompassing all radar data and Gaia DR3 observations. The orbital computation was performed for a total of 446 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs; including 93 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)), and 54094 Inner Main Belt Asteroids (IMBAs) as well as Mars Crossing asteroids. Furthermore, we used a new validation method which involved computing the A2 (the Yarkovsky effect) using different observational arcs to observe the stability of the result. We applied the Yarkovsky effect to determine the density of the studied asteroids. <BR /> Results: Thanks to Gaia DR3 we significantly constrained orbital uncertainties and determined reliable A2 values for 49 Near-Earth Asteroids, including 10 new detections and for all improvements in signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, we successfully determined the density, along with their uncertainties, for all of these objects. However, regarding IMBAs, although we have made progress, we do not detect Yarkovsky drift for any asteroid in the main belt. <BR /> Conclusions: Adding a relatively small amount of ultra-precise astrometry from Gaia DR3 to the observations from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) not only significantly improves the orbit of the asteroid but also enhances the detectability of non-gravitational parameters. Utilizing this improved dataset, we were able to determine the densities, along with their uncertainties, for the studied asteroids. Looking ahead, with the upcoming release of Gaia DR4, we anticipate even more detections for NEAs and new detections for IMBA and Mars Crossing Asteroids.",

      "abstract": "Context. Asteroids smaller than about 100 m in diameter are observed to rotate very fast, with periods often much shorter than the critical spin limit of 2.2 h. Some of these super-fast rotators can also achieve a very large semimajor axis drift induced by the Yarkovsky effect, which, in turn, is determined by internal and surface physical properties. <BR /> Aims: We consider here a small super-fast-rotating near-Earth asteroid, designated as 2016 GE1. This object rotates in just about 34 s, and a large Yarkovsky effect has been determined from astrometry. By using these results, we aim to constrain the thermal inertia of the surface of this extreme object. <BR /> Methods: We used a recently developed statistical method to determine the thermal properties of near-Earth asteroids. The method is based on the comparison between the observed and the modeled Yarkovsky effect, and the thermal conductivity (inertia) is determined via a Monte Carlo approach. Parameters of the Yarkovsky effect model are fixed if their uncertainty is negligible, modeled with a Gaussian distribution of the errors if they are measured, or deduced from general properties of the population of near-Earth asteroids when they are unknown. <BR /> Results: Using a well-established orbit determination procedure, we determined the Yarkovsky effect on 2016 GE1 and confirm a significant semimajor axis drift rate. Using a statistical method, we show that this semimajor axis drift rate can only be explained by low thermal inertia values below 100 J m<SUP>−2</SUP> K<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1/2</SUP>. We benchmarked our statistical method using the well-characterized asteroid Bennu and find that only knowing the semimajor axis drift rate and the rotation period is generally insufficient for determining the thermal inertia. However, when the statistical method is applied to super-fast rotators, we find that the measured Yarkovsky effect can be achieved only for very low values of thermal inertia: namely, 90% of the probability density function of the model outcomes is contained at values smaller than 100 J m<SUP>−2</SUP> K<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1/2</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: We propose two possible interpretations for the extremely low thermal inertia of 2016 GE1: a high porosity or a cracked surface, or a thin layer of fine regolith on the surface. Though both possibilities seem somewhat unexpected, this opens up the possibility of a subclass of low-inertia, super-fast-rotating asteroids.",

The effect is subtle ( $\\left\\langle {da}/{dt}\\right\\rangle \\sim {10}^{-4}$ au My<SUP>-1</SUP> for a 1 km diameter object) and is thus generally difficult to measure. We analyzed both optical and radar astrometry for 600 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect. We present 247 NEAs with measured drift rates, which is the largest published set of Yarkovsky detections. This large sample size provides an opportunity to examine the Yarkovsky effect in a statistical manner. In particular, we describe two independent population-based tests that verify the measurement of Yarkovsky orbital drift. First, we provide observational confirmation for the Yarkovsky effect's theoretical size dependence of 1/D, where D is diameter. Second, we find that the observed ratio of negative to positive drift rates in our sample is 2.34, which, accounting for bias and sampling uncertainty, implies an actual ratio of ${2.7}_{-0.7}^{+0.3}$ . This ratio has a vanishingly small probability of occurring due to chance or statistical noise. The observed ratio of retrograde to prograde rotators is two times lower than the ratio expected from numerical predictions from NEA population studies and traditional assumptions about the sense of rotation of NEAs originating from various main belt escape routes. We also examine the efficiency with which solar energy is converted into orbital energy and find a median efficiency in our sample of 12%. We interpret this efficiency in terms of NEA spin and thermal properties.",

Furthermore, we find a list of 24 marginally significant detections for which future astrometry could result in a Yarkovsky detection. A further outcome of the filtering procedure is a list of detections that we consider spurious because they are either unrealistic or not explicable by the Yarkovsky effect. Among the smallest asteroids of our sample, we determined four detections of solar radiation pressure in addition to the Yarkovsky effect. As the data volume increases in the near future, our goal is to develop methods to generate very long lists of asteroids that have a Yarkovsky effect that is reliably detected and have limited amounts of case by case specific adjustments.

We find 21 NEAs whose orbital fits show a measurable orbital drift with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3.

Furthermore, the distribution of the detected orbital drifts shows an excess of retrograde rotators that can be connected to the delivery mechanism from the most important NEA feeding resonances and allows us to infer the obliquity distribution of NEAs. We discuss the implications of the Yarkovsky effect for impact predictions.

The asymmetry is related to the synchronous rotation of the Moon: there is a higher density of rayed craters on the leading hemisphere compared with the trailing hemisphere. Rayed craters represent generally the youngest impacts. <BR /> Aims: The purpose of this paper is to test the hypotheses that (i) the population of Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is the source of the impactors that have made the rayed craters; and (ii) that impacts by this projectile population account quantitatively for the observed asymmetry. <BR /> Methods: We carried out numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of a large number of test particles representing NEAs in order to determine directly their impact flux on the Moon. The simulations were done in two stages. In the first stage we obtained encounter statistics of NEAs on the Earth's activity sphere. In the second stage we calculated the direct impact flux of the encountering particles on the surface of the Moon; the latter calculations were confined within the activity sphere of the Earth. A steady-state synthetic population of NEAs was generated from a debiased orbital distribution of the known NEAs. <BR /> Results: We find that the near-Earth asteroids do have an asymmetry in their impact flux on the Moon: apex-to-antapex ratio of 1.32 ± 0.01. However, the observed rayed crater distribution's asymmetry is significantly more pronounced: apex-to-antapex ratio of 1.65 ± 0.16. Our results suggest the existence of an undetected population of slower (low impact velocity) projectiles, such as a population of objects nearly coorbiting with Earth; more observational studies of young lunar craters is needed to secure this conclusion.",

The latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range. Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the km-size range is 200±40 JmsK. Furthermore, we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is a more complex function than the generally adopted D dependence, and that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than generally assumed. We discuss how this fact may help to explain the small difference in the slope of the size distribution of km-sized NEAs and main-belt asteroids.",

Collisional processes have long been claimed as a possible source, but difficulties with that idea have led to the suggestion that orbital drift arising from the Yarkovsky effect dominates the injection process. (The Yarkovsky effect is a force arising from differential heating-the `afternoon' side of an asteroid is warmer than the `morning' side.) The two models predict different rotational properties of NEAs: the usual collisional theories are consistent with a nearly isotropic distribution of rotation vectors, whereas the `Yarkovsky model' predicts an excess of retrograde rotations. Here we report that the spin vectors of NEAs show a strong and statistically significant excess of retrograde rotations, quantitatively consistent with the theoretical expectations of the Yarkovsky model.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the relevance of the Yarkovsky effect for the origin of kilometer and multikilometer near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The Yarkovsky effect causes a slow migration in semimajor axis of main belt asteroids, some of which are therefore captured into powerful resonances and transported to the NEA space. With an innovative simulation scheme, we determine that in the current steady-state situation 100-160 bodies with H &lt; 18 (roughly larger than 1 km) enter the 3/1 resonance per million years and 40-60 enter the ν <SUB>6</SUB> resonance. The ranges are due to uncertainties on relevant simulation parameters such as the time scales for collisional disruption and reorientation, their size dependence, and the strength of the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. These flux rates to the resonances are consistent with those independently derived by Bottke et al. (2002, Icarus 156, 399-433) with considerations based only on the NEA orbital distribution and dynamical lifetime. Our results have been obtained assuming that the main belt contains 1,300,000 asteroids with H &lt; 18 and linearly scale with this number. Assuming that the cumulative magnitude distribution of main belt asteroids is N(&lt; H) ∝ 10 <SUP>γ' H</SUP> with γ' = 0.25 in the 15.5 &lt; H &lt; 18 range (consistent with the results of the SDSS survey), we obtain that the bodies captured into the resonances should have a similar magnitude distribution, but with exponent coefficient γ = 0.33-0.40. The lowest value is obtained taking into account the YORP effect, while higher values correspond to a weakened YORP or to YORP-less cases. These values of γ are all compatible with the debiased magnitude distributions of the NEAs according to Rabinowitz et al. (2000, Nature 403, 165-166), Bottke et al. (2000b, Science 288, 2190-2194), and Stuart (2001, Science 294, 1691-1693). Hence the Yarkovsky and YORP effects allow us to understand why the magnitude distribution of NEAs is only moderately steeper than that of the main belt population. The steepest main belt distribution that would still be compatible with the NEA distribution has exponent coefficient γ' ∼ 0.3.",

Its importance has been recently demonstrated in relation to the transport of material from the main asteroid belt (both to explain the origin of near-Earth asteroids and some properties of meteorites) and also in relation to the aging processes of the asteroid families. However, unlike the case of the artificial satellites, the Yarkovsky effect has never been measured or detected in the motion of natural bodies in the Solar System. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting the Yarkovsky effect via precise orbit determination of near-Earth asteroids. Such a detection is feasible only with the existence of precise radar astrometry at multiple apparitions. Since the observability of the Yarkovsky perturbation accumulates quadratically with time the time span between radar observations is a critical factor. Though the current data do not clearly indicate the Yarkovsky effect in the motion of these bodies, we predict that the next apparition of several asteroids (in particular, 6489 Golevka, 1620 Geographos, and possibly 1566 Icarus) might reveal its existence. Moreover, we show that the Yarkovsky effect may play a very important role in the orbit determination of small, but still observable, bodies like 1998 KY <SUB>26</SUB>. If carefully followed, this body may serve as a superb probe of the Yarkovsky effect in its next close approach to the Earth in June 2024.",

The geometric albedo of 2001 QJ<SUB>142</SUB> is derived to be about 0.3 from a slope of its photometric phase curve, which is consistent with an albedo derived from thermal observations with updated physical quantities. A straightforward interpretation is that 2001 QJ<SUB>142</SUB> is either an E- or M-type asteroid, although surface properties of such tiny fast-rotating asteroids are not well understood. Conclusions. We infer that 2001 QJ<SUB>142</SUB> is a fast-rotating mission-accessible E- or M-type near-Earth asteroid. More characterizations of tiny asteroids are particularly important for a deeper understanding of their nature.",

The radar campaign started at Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) on April 7, and it was followed by more extensive observations from October 5 to 9 by both Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) and Goldstone. 2018 EB was observed optically on April 5, 8, and 9 and again on October 18. Spectrophotometry was obtained on October 19 with the SOAR telescope, and the data suggest that 2018 EB is an Xk-class object. The echo power spectra and delay-Doppler radar images revealed that 2018 EB is a binary system. Radar images constrained the satellite's diameter to km, but the data were not sufficient for shape modeling. Shape modeling of lightcurves and radar data yielded an oblate primary with an effective diameter D = 0.30 ± 0.04 km and a sidereal rotation period of hr. Measurements of delay-Doppler separations between the centers of mass of the primary and the satellite, along with the timing of a radar eclipse observed on October 9, resulted in an orbit fit for the satellite with a semimajor axis of km, an eccentricity of 0.15 ± 0.04, a period of hr, and an orbit pole constrained to the ecliptic longitudes and latitudes of and . The system mass was estimated to be kg, which yielded a bulk density of g cm<SUP>‑3</SUP>. Our analysis suggests that 2018 EB has a low optical albedo of p <SUB> V </SUB> = 0.028 ± 0.016 and a relatively high radar albedo of η <SUB> OC </SUB> = 0.29 ± 0.11 at Arecibo and η = 0.22 ± 0.10 at Goldstone.",

      "abstract": "On 2020 April 29, the near-Earth object (52768) 1998 OR2 experienced a close approach to Earth at a distance of 16.4 lunar distances (LD). 1998 OR2 is a potentially hazardous asteroid of absolute magnitude H = 16.04 that can currently come as close to Earth as 3.4 LD. We report here observations of this object in polarimetry, photometry, and radar. Our observations show that the physical characteristics of 1998 OR2 are similar to those of both M- and S-type asteroids. Arecibo's radar observations provide a high radar albedo of ${\\hat{\\sigma }}_{\\mathrm{OC}}\\,=$ 0.29 ± 0.08, suggesting that metals are present in 1998 OR2 near-surface. We find a circular polarization ratio of μ <SUB> c </SUB> = 0.291 ± 0.012, and the delay-Doppler images show that the surface of 1998 OR2 is a top-shape asteroid with large-scale structures such as large craters and concavities. The polarimetric observations display a consistent variation of the polarimetric response as a function of the rotational phase, suggesting that the surface of 1998 OR2 is heterogeneous. Color observations suggest an X-complex taxonomy in the Bus–DeMeo classification. Combining optical polarization, radar, and two epochs from the NEOWISE satellite observations, we derived an equivalent diameter of D = 1.80 ± 0.1 km and a visual albedo p <SUB>v</SUB> = 0.21 ± 0.02. Photometric and radar data provide a sidereal rotation period of P = 4.10872 ± 0.00001 hr, a pole orientation of (332.°3 ± 5°, 20.°7 ± 5°), and a shape model with dimensions of <P />$({2.08}_{-0.10}^{+0.10},{1.93}_{-0.10}^{+0.10},{1.60}_{-0.05}^{+0.05})$ km.",

The similarity of its reflectance spectrum to lunar silicates and its Earth-like orbit both suggest that it originated from the lunar surface. Here we carry out numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of particles launched from different locations on the lunar surface with a range of ejection velocities in order to assess the hypothesis that Kamo`oalewa originated as a debris-fragment from a meteoroidal impact with the lunar surface. As these ejecta escape the Earth-Moon environment, they face a dynamical barrier for entry into Earth's co-orbital space. However, a small fraction of launch conditions yields outcomes that are compatible with Kamo`oalewa's orbit. The most favored conditions are launch velocities slightly above the escape velocity from the trailing lunar hemisphere.",

We report that 2000 PN9 is a relatively large top-shaped body with a sidereal rotation period of 2.53216 ± 0.00015 h.

Our findings represent the first reliable determination of Baboquivari's physical properties. We used data from a 1m-class telescope (T100) along with ALCDEF data for photometric analyses and a 1.5-m-class telescope (RTT150) for polarimetric, spectroscopic, and additional photometric observations. We obtained the synodic rotation period of Baboquivari as 129.93 ± 2.31 h and the standard phase function parameters H and G as 16.05 ± 0.05, 0.22 ± 0.02, respectively. Our colour index (V-R) measurement of 0.45 ± 0.02 is consistent with spectroscopic observations, indicating an S (or sub-S) spectral type. Using the polarimetric and spectroscopic data, we found that the geometric albedo is 0.15 ± 0.03, and the spectral type is Sq. Based on the estimated albedo and absolute magnitude, Baboquivari has an effective diameter of 2.12 ± 0.21 km. Due to the scattered data in the light curve, its slow rotation and location among the NEAs suggest that Baboquivari may be a non-principal axis (NPA) rotator.",

For some of these bodies, local acceleration near the equator may be directed outwards so that lift off of near-equatorial material is possible. In particular, this may be the case for asteroid Didymos, the primary of the (65803) Didymos binary system, which is the target of the DART (NASA) and Hera (ESA) space missions. The study of the dynamics of particles in such an environment has been carried out - in the frame of the Hera mission and the EC-H2020 NEO-MAPP project - according to the available shape model, known physical parameters and orbital information available before the DART impact. The presence of orbiting particles in the system is likely for most of the estimated range of values for mass and volume. The spatial mass density of ejected material is calculated for different particle sizes and at different heliocentric orbit epochs, revealing that large particles dominate the mass density distribution and that small particle abundance depends on observation epoch. Estimates of take off and landing areas on Didymos are also reported. Available estimates of the system mass and primary extents, after the DART mission, confirm that the main conclusions of this study are valid in the context of current knowledge.",

Out of 33 asteroids with an estimated effective diameter of at least 200 m and sufficient image quality to give clues of the shape, at least 4 (~12%) are binary asteroids, including 1 equal-mass binary asteroid, 2017 YE5, and at least 10 (~30%) are contact-binary asteroids. For 5 out of 112 asteroids with reliable measurements in both circular polarizations, we measured circular-polarization ratios greater than 1.0, which could indicate that they are E-type asteroids, while the mean and the 1σ standard deviation were 0.37 ± 0.23. Further, we find a mean opposite-sense circular-polarization radar albedo of 0.21 ± 0.11 for 41 asteroids (0.19 ± 0.06 for 11 S-complex asteroids).

The spin-state is difficult to constrain with the available data; including a certain light-curve subset significantly changes the spin-state estimates, and the uncertainties on period determination are significant. Constraining any change in rotation rate was not possible, despite decades of observations. The convex light curve-inversion model, with rotational pole at λ = 210° ± 41° and β = -30° ± 35°, is more flattened than the two models reconstructed by including radar observations: with prograde (λ = 36° ± 23°, β = 30° ± 15°), and with retrograde rotation mode (λ = 180° ± 24°, β = -30 ± 16°). Using data from WISE, we were able to determine that the prograde model produces the best agreement in size determination between radar and thermophysical modelling. Radar measurements indicate possible variation in surface properties, suggesting one side might have lower radar albedo and be rougher at the centimetre-to-decimetre scale than the other. However, further observations are needed to confirm this. Thermophysical analysis indicates a surface covered in fine-grained regolith, consistent with radar albedo, and polarisation ratio measurements. Finally, geophysical investigation of the spin-stability of Tantalus shows that it could be exceeding its critical spin-rate via cohesive forces.",

It will hit the Didymos secondary, called Dimorphos, on 2022 September 26. We observed Didymos with 11 telescopes with diameters from 3.5 to 10.4 m during four apparitions in 2015-2021, obtaining data with rms residuals from 0.006 to 0.030 mag. We analyzed the light-curve data and decomposed them into the primary rotational and secondary orbital light curves. We detected 37 mutual eclipse/occultation events between the binary system components. The data presented here, in combination with 18 mutual events detected in 2003, provide the basis for modeling the Dimorphos orbit around the Didymos primary. The orbit modeling is discussed in detail by Scheirich &amp; Pravec and Naidu et al. The primary light curves were complex, showing multiple extrema on some epochs. They suggest a presence of complex topography on the primary's surface that is apparent in specific viewing/illumination geometries; the primary shape model by Naidu et al. (Icarus 348, 113777, 2020) needs to be refined. The secondary rotational light-curve data were limited and did not provide a clear solution for the rotation period and equatorial elongation of Dimorphos. We define the requirements for observations of the secondary light curve to provide the needed information on Dimorphos's rotation and elongation when Didymos is bright in 2022 July-September before the DART impact.",

      "abstract": "Near-Earth asteroid 153814 (2001 WN5) was discovered on 2001 November 20 by the LONEOS survey. Based on its absolute magnitude of 18.3 (or diameter within a factor of two of 750 m) and minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of less than 0.002 au, it was designated a potentially hazardous asteroid. This object was on the SENTRY list of possible Earth impactors until early 2002 when sufficient astrometry was collected to show previous potential impacts were no longer consistent with observations. Asteroid 153814 is of particular interest because it will make a very close flyby of Earth, within the orbit of the Moon, on 2028 June 26 at a distance of 0.65 lunar distances (250,000 km). Because this close approach occurs one year prior to the extremely close flyby of 99942 Apophis on 2029 April 13, asteroid 153814 is of interest as a possible rehearsal target for an Apophis observing campaign. Here, we will summarize the physical characterization of 153814 based on multiple apparitions of radar observations by Arecibo Observatory and infrared observations by the NEOWISE spacecraft. <P />Asteroid 153814 was observed with the Arecibo S-band (2380 MHz; 12.6 cm) planetary radar on 2010 October 29 and 30 providing Doppler-only, echo-power spectra and coarse ranging at a resolution of 600 m and again from 2019 August 21 to 25 providing additional echo-power spectra and coarse imaging at a resolution of 75 m. Four ranging measurements with precision on the order of 100 meters were reported. Additionally, NEOWISE observed 153814 at seven epochs between 2010 January 18 and 2020 January 23 with varying degrees of signal strength due to distances ranging from 0.1 to 1.8 au. We will present best estimates for the size, shape, spin state, and scattering properties of asteroid 153814. <P />In 2028, asteroid 153814 will become brighter than magnitude 22 by February 8 at ~90o solar elongation. It will remain at southern declinations, moving from -17o to -75o, through its close approach of 0.65 lunar distances. It will peak at brighter than magnitude 7, then fade as it moves to northern declinations. Such a close approach provides a very accessible target for optical lightcurve and spectroscopic observations as well as an extremely strong radar target. Although too far south during the exact moment of closest approach, 153814 will be observable by the Goldstone (DSS-14; 70 m) radar from mid-June to June 24 and then again just after close approach on June 26 into early July, allowing for high-resolution imaging as fine as meters per pixel. A similar viewing opportunity, narrowly missing the exact moment of closest approach, is available to the Green Bank Telescope, which is working on its own radar transmit capability. The far, southern declination of the close approach will be ideal for a southern hemisphere radar such as on the Canberra (DSS-43; 70 m) Deep Space Network antenna. Meanwhile, 153814 will be detectable by NEO Surveyor at multiple epochs between the beginning of its survey and the 2028 close flyby of Earth.",

The DART spacecraft will impact the satellite, causing changes in the binary orbit that will be measured by Earth-based observers. We observed Didymos using the planetary radars at Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) and Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) in November 2003. Delay-Doppler radar imaging of the binary system provided range resolutions of up to 15 m/pixel that placed hundreds of pixels on the primary. We used the radar data to estimate a 3D shape model and spin state for the primary, the secondary size and spin, the mutual orbit parameters, and the radar scattering properties of the binary system. We included lightcurves obtained by Pravec et al. (2006) in the shape model estimation. The primary is top-shaped with an equatorial bulge, a conspicuous facet along the equator, and a volume-equivalent diameter of 780 ± 30 m. The extents along the three principal axes are 832 m, 838 m, and 786 m, (uncertainties are 6% along the x and y axes, and 10% along the z axis). The radar data do not provide complete rotational coverage of the secondary but show visible extents of about 75 m, implying a diameter of 150 ± 30 m. The bandwidth of the secondary in the images suggests a spin period of 12.4 ± 3.0 h that is consistent with rotation that is synchronized with the mutual orbit period of 11.9 h. We fit a mutual orbit to the system using the delay and Doppler separations between the binary components and obtain a semimajor axis of 1190 ± 30 m, an eccentricity of &lt;0.05, and an orbital period of 11.93 ± 0.01 h that are consistent with those obtained by Scheirich and Pravec (2009) and Fang and Margot (2012). The mutual orbit implies a system mass of (5.4 ± 0.4) x 10<SUP>11</SUP> kg and a system bulk density of 2170 ± 350 kg m<SUP>-</SUP><SUP>3</SUP>. The system has S- and X-band radar albedos of 0.20 ± 0.05 and 0.30 ± 0.08 respectively, and an optical albedo of 0.15 ± 0.04.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of 1991 VG on 1991 November 6 attracted an unprecedented amount of attention as it was the first near-Earth object (NEO) ever found on an Earth-like orbit. At that time, it was considered by some as the first representative of a new dynamical class of asteroids, while others argued that an artificial (terrestrial or extraterrestrial) origin was more likely. Over a quarter of a century later, this peculiar NEO has been recently recovered and the new data may help in confirming or ruling out early theories about its origin. Here, we use the latest data to perform an independent assessment of its current dynamical status and short-term orbital evolution. Extensive N-body simulations show that its orbit is chaotic on time-scales longer than a few decades. We confirm that 1991 VG was briefly captured by Earth's gravity as a minimoon during its previous fly-by in 1991-1992; although it has been a recurrent transient co-orbital of the horseshoe type in the past and it will return as such in the future, it is not a present-day co-orbital companion of the Earth. A realistic NEO orbital model predicts that objects like 1991 VG must exist and, consistently, we have found three other NEOs - 2001 GP<SUB>2</SUB>, 2008 UA<SUB>202</SUB> and 2014 WA<SUB>366</SUB> - which are dynamically similar to 1991 VG. All this evidence confirms that there is no compelling reason to believe that 1991 VG is not natural.",

We also refined previously determined values of parameters of both components, making 1996 FG<SUB>3</SUB> one of the most well understood binary asteroid systems. With our 17-year long dataset, we determined the orbital vector with a substantially greater accuracy than before and we also placed constraints on a stability of the orbit.

We looked for a quadratic drift of the mean anomaly of the satellite and obtained a value of 0.04 ± 0.20 deg /yr<SUP>2</SUP> , i.e., consistent with zero. The drift is substantially lower than predicted by the pure binary YORP (BYORP) theory of McMahon and Scheeres (McMahon, J., Scheeres, D. [2010].

We have found that binary systems with a secondary-to-primary mean diameter ratio D/D⩾0.18 concentrate among NEAs smaller than 2 km in diameter; the abundance of such binaries decreases significantly among larger NEAs. Secondaries show an upper size limit of D=0.5-1 km. Systems with D/D⩽0.5 are abundant but larger satellites are significantly less common. Primaries have spheroidal shapes and they rotate rapidly, with periods concentrating between 2.2 to 2.8 h and with a tail of the distribution up to ∼4 h. The fast rotators are close to the critical spin for rubble piles with bulk densities about 2 g/cm <SUP>3</SUP>. Orbital periods show an apparent cut-off at P∼11 h; closer systems with shorter orbital periods have not been discovered, which is consistent with the Roche limit for strengthless bodies. Secondaries are more elongated on average than primaries. Most, but not all, of their rotations appear to be synchronized with the orbital motion; nonsynchronous secondary rotations may occur especially among wider systems with P&gt;20 h. The specific total angular momentum of most of the binary systems is similar to within ±20% and close to the angular momentum of a sphere with the same total mass and density, rotating at the disruption limit; this suggests that the binaries were created by mechanism(s) related to rotation near the critical limit and that they neither gained nor lost significant amounts of angular momentum during or since formation. A comparison with six small asynchronous binaries detected in the main belt of asteroids suggests that the population extends beyond the region of terrestrial planets, but with characteristics shifted to larger sizes and longer periods. The estimated mean proportion of binaries with D/D⩾0.18 among NEAs larger than 0.3 km is 15±4%. Among fastest rotating NEAs larger than 0.3 km with periods between 2.2 and 2.8 h, the mean proportion of such binaries is (66 <SUP>+10</SUP><SUB>-12</SUB>)%.",

      "abstract": "We present numerical simulations of near-Earth asteroid (NEA) tidal disruption resulting in bound, mutually orbiting systems. Using a rubble pile model we have constrained the relative likelihoods for possible physical and dynamical properties of the binaries created. Overall 110,500 simulations were run, with each body consisting of ∼1000 particles. The encounter parameters of close approach distance and velocity were varied, as were the bodies' spin, elongation and spin axis direction. The binary production rate increases for closer encounters, at lower speeds, for more elongated bodies, and for bodies with greater spin. The semimajor axes for resultant binaries are peaked between 5 to 20 primary radii, and there is an overall trend for high eccentricity, with 97% of binaries having e &gt; 0.1. The secondary-to-primary size ratios of the simulated binaries are peaked between 0.1 and 0.2, similar to trends among observed asteroid binaries. The spin rates of the primary bodies are narrowly distributed between 3.5- and 6-h periods, whereas the secondaries' periods are more evenly distributed and can exceed 15-h periods. The spin axes of the primary bodies are very closely aligned with the angular momenta of the binary orbits, whereas the secondary spin axes are nearly random. The shapes of the primaries show a large distribution of axis ratios, where those with low elongation (ratio of long and short axis) are both oblate and prolate, and nearly all with large elongation are prolate. This work presents results that suggest tidal disruption of gravitational aggregates can make binaries physically similar to those currently observed in the NEA population. As well, tidal disruption may create an equal number of binaries with qualities different from those observed, mostly binaries with large separation and with elongated primaries.",

Numerical experiments are performed to determine its medium-term stability and the means by which it may have entered its current orbit. Though 3753 moves primarily under the influence of the Sun and Earth, the giant planets (and Jupiter especially) play an important role by influencing, through torque-induced precession, the position of the asteroid's nodes. Variations in the nodal distance strongly affect the interaction of 3753 with Earth and may change or destroy the horseshoe-like behavior currently seen. This precession of the nodes provides a mechanism for placing minor planets into, or removing them from, a variety of horseshoe-type orbits. The chaotic nature of this asteroid's orbit makes predictions difficult on timescales longer than its Lyapunov time (~150 yr); therefore, ensembles of particles on orbits near that of 3753 are considered. The asteroid has a high probability of passing close to Venus and/or Mars on 10^4 yr timescales, pointing to a dynamical age much shorter than that of the solar system.",

We combine previously published thermal properties for NEAs with newly derived values for three binary NEAs. The η value derived from the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM) for each object is then used to estimate an average thermal inertia for the population of binary NEAs and compared against similar estimates for the population of non-binaries. We find that these objects have, in general, surface temperatures cooler than the average values for non-binary NEAs as suggested by elevated η values. We discuss how this may be evidence of higher-than-average surface thermal inertia. This latter physical parameter is a sensitive indicator of the presence or absence of regolith: bodies covered with fine regolith, such as the Earth’s moon, have low thermal inertia, whereas a surface with little or no regolith displays high thermal inertia. Our results are suggestive of a binary formation mechanism capable of altering surface properties, possibly removing regolith: an obvious candidate is the YORP effect. <P />We present also newly determined sizes and geometric visible albedos derived from thermal-infrared observations of three binary NEAs: (5381) Sekhmet, (153591) 2001 SN<SUB>263</SUB>, and (164121) 2003 YT<SUB>1</SUB>.

The measured fluxes have been fitted with thermal-model emission continua to determine sizes and albedos. This work increases the number of NEAs having measured albedos by 35%. The spread of albedos derived is very large ( p<SUB>v</SUB>=0.02-0.55); the mean value is 0.25, which is much higher than that of observed main-belt asteroids. In most cases the albedos are in the ranges expected for the spectral types, although some exceptions are evident. Our results are consistent with a trend of increasing albedo with decreasing size for S-type asteroids with diameters below 20 km. A number of objects are found to have unexpectedly low apparent color temperatures, which may reflect unusual thermal properties. However, the results from our limited sample suggest that high thermal-inertia, regolith-free objects may be uncommon, even amongst NEAs with diameters of less than 1 km. We discuss the significance of our results in the light of information on these NEAs taken from the literature and the uncertainties inherent in applying thermal models to near-Earth asteroids.",

However, near-Earth asteroids are relatively small and are expected to have less dusty, \"rockier,\" surfaces with higher thermal inertias than main-belt asteroids. Furthermore, they tend to have irregular shapes and are often observed at large solar phase angles, compared to main-belt objects. Therefore, the applicability of the commonly used asteroid thermal models to these objects is not self-evident. Radiometric data in the 4-20-μm range of several near-Earth asteroids are compared with model predictions of the thermal emission. For all the objects considered both the \"standard\" and \"fast rotating\" thermal models produce poor fits to the observational data. Simple modifications to the standard thermal model are described that lead to significantly improved fits to the data. Revised estimates of the albedos and sizes of a number of near-Earth asteroids are derived using the resulting new thermal model with an empirically derived calibration parameter and compared with existing data from other sources. The new model is proposed as a default simple thermal model for estimating albedos and diameters of near-Earth asteroids.",

However, tidal disruptions of NEAs have never been directly observed nor have they been directly attributed to any families of NEAs. Here we show population-level evidence for the tidal disruption of NEAs during close encounters with Earth and Venus. Debiased model distributions of NEA orbits and absolute magnitudes based on observations by the Catalina Sky Survey during 2005-2012 underpredict the number of NEAs with perihelion distances coinciding with the semimajor axes of Venus and Earth. A detailed analysis of the orbital distributions of the excess NEAs shows that their characteristics agree with the prediction for tidal disruptions, and they cannot be explained by observational selection effects or orbital dynamics. Accounting for tidal disruptions in evolutionary models of the NEA population partly bridges the gap between the predicted rate of impacts by asteroids with diameters of tens of meters and observed statistics of fireballs in the same size range.",

      "abstract": "The known near-Earth object (NEO) population consists of over 32,000 objects, with a yearly discovery rate of over 3000 NEOs per year. An essential component of the next generation of NEO surveys is an understanding of the population of known objects, including an accounting of the discovery rate per year as a function of size. Using a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) reference model developed for NASA's NEO Surveyor (NEOS) mission and a model of the major current and historical ground-based surveys, an estimate of the current NEA survey completeness as a function of size and absolute magnitude has been determined (termed the Known Object Model; KOM). This allows for understanding of the intersection of the known catalog of NEAs and the objects expected to be observed by NEOS. The current NEA population is found to be ~38% complete for objects larger than 140 m, consistent with estimates by Harris &amp; Chodas. NEOS is expected to catalog more than two-thirds of the NEAs larger than 140 m, resulting in ~76% of NEAs cataloged at the end of its 5 yr nominal survey, making significant progress toward the US Congressional mandate. The KOM estimates that ~77% of the currently cataloged objects will be detected by NEOS, with those not detected contributing ~9% to the final completeness at the end of its 5 yr mission. This model allows for placing the NEOS mission in the context of current surveys to more completely assess the progress toward the goal of cataloging the population of hazardous asteroids.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we update, extend, and improve upon the recent paper on Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) population by Harris and D'Abramo (2015). We update the population estimate taking into account discoveries to August 3, 2020. Shortly after the previous paper was published, we identified a problem in our previous studies due to rounding off of absolute magnitude H by the Minor Planet Center to 0.1 magnitude that implicitly shifted our bin boundaries by 0.05 magnitude. Here we correct the problem by choosing H bin boundaries at 0.25-0.75 magnitude, rather than 0.00-0.50 magnitude thereby eliminating the round-off shift. We also introduce an updated model distribution of NEA orbits (Granvik et al. 2018) in our survey simulations. This new population model includes orbital distributions as a function of size, allowing us to test our presumption that distributions are homologous with respect to size. The change in distribution of orbits between that used by Harris and D'Abramo (2015) and the newer Granvik et al. (2018) distributions was substantially greater than the range over size given in the latter, but made almost no difference in population estimates, suggesting that the re-detection algorithm is robust and does not depend strongly on the detailed orbit distribution, and also validates our presumption of homologous distribution over size. For the current analysis, we have added ATLAS and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to our analysis. We have separately analyzed the re-detection ratio versus size (H magnitude) for each of four surveys (Catalina + Mt. Lemmon, Pan-STARRS, ATLAS and ZTF) to investigate any differences between the various systems and cadences, and found none of significance, thus again, the re-detection algorithm appears very robust and mostly independent of survey parameters. With these changes and more recent discovery statistics to 2020, we estimate the number of NEAs of absolute magnitude H &lt; 17.75 (nominally D &gt; 1 km) to be 940 ± 10. Following the updated population estimate, we examine more closely the rates of discovery of the largest NEAs (absolute magnitude H &lt; 17.75, nominally diameter D &gt; 1 km) to make a more detailed estimate of the numbers of these large objects that remain undiscovered. Lastly we use the distribution of albedos of NEAs from NEOWISE observations (Mainzer et al. 2011) to transform our population estimate from number versus H, N(&lt;H), to number versus D, N(&gt;D). Unfortunately this transformation depends substantially on only minor uncertainties in the albedo distribution, so N(&gt;D) remains much less certain than N(&lt;H).",

All associations were found with a high statistical reliability using a single linkage cluster analysis algorithm and three orbital similarity functions. The identified groups constitute a small fraction (4.74 per cent) of the entire sample. Notwithstanding, they may be hazardous to Earth and its inhabitants. As with meteoroid streams, every year Earth comes very close to the orbits of each association. In two cases (2008TC3 and 2017FU102), the distance between the asteroid's orbit and Earth's orbit was shorter than Earth's radius. Among the members of the identified associations, we found 331 objects larger than the Chelyabinsk asteroid and all of them approach Earth's orbit at a distance smaller than 0.05 au. Two of the identified groups, (4179) Toutatis and (251430) Itokawa, support the hypothesis regarding the catastrophic origins of the asteroids Toutatis and Itokawa through violent collisions. This study does not focus on the origin of the NEA associations, but rather focuses on tracing the associations. Regardless of their origin, the identified groups pose a serious threat to Earth. Hence, to facilitate their monitoring of we calculated coordinates of the theoretical radiants and the calendar dates of their potential activity.",

The albedos of 428 near Earth asteroids (NEAs) observed by WISE during its fully cryogenic mission can be fit quite well by a three parameter function that is the sum of two Rayleigh distributions. The Rayleigh distribution is zero for negative values, and follows f(x) =x\\exp [-{x}<SUP>2</SUP>/(2{σ }<SUP>2</SUP>)]/{σ }<SUP>2</SUP> for positive x. The peak value is at x = σ, so the position and width are tied together. The three parameters are the fraction of the objects in the dark population, the position of the dark peak, and the position of the brighter peak. We find that 25.3% of the NEAs observed by WISE are in a very dark population peaking at p <SUB> V </SUB> = 0.030, while the other 74.7% of the NEAs seen by WISE are in a moderately dark population peaking at p <SUB> V </SUB> = 0.168. A consequence of this bimodal distribution is that the congressional mandate to find 90% of all NEAs larger than 140 m diameter cannot be satisfied by surveying to H = 22 mag, since a 140 m diameter asteroid at the very dark peak has H = 23.7 mag, and more than 10% of NEAs are darker than p <SUB> V </SUB> = 0.03.",

      "abstract": "We describe a methodology of estimating the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). We estimate the completion versus size of present surveys based on the re-detection ratio, that is, the fraction of all detections over a recent period that are re-detections of already discovered objects rather than new discoveries. The re-detection ratio is a robust measure of completion, but must be corrected for the obvious bias caused by differences in ease of discovery due to specific orbital geometries. We do this with a computer survey simulation using a large set of synthetic orbital elements matching as best possible the distribution of the real NEA population. Once suitably \"calibrated\" to match re-detections of the real survey, the completion estimate versus size derived from the simulation can be extended both to large size where few if any new detections are recorded, and to small sizes beyond where re-detection numbers are statistically significant, thereby providing an estimate of the population and survey completion over the entire range from the largest NEAs down to the smallest sizes detected (∼3 m diameter). Here we update our previous population estimates and survey progress, using discoveries by surveys from August, 2012 through July, 2014. We estimate that there are 990 ± 20 NEAs larger than 1 km in diameter (absolute magnitude H ⩽ 17.75), of which about 90% have been discovered as of August, 2014. We confirm a \"dip\" in the SFD, in the range from a few tens to a few hundreds of meters diameter, which may be due to the transition from larger \"rubble pile\" bodies to smaller \"monolithic\" bodies. We compare our population estimate at the smallest sizes with recent ones based on bolide frequency and find excellent agreement, within estimated errors. The same survey simulation methodology can be used to investigate population and survey completion of various subset populations, for example Earth-Crossing Asteroids (ECAs, with orbits crossing 1 AU heliocentric distance), Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs, with orbits passing within 0.05 AU of the Earth's orbit), or Interior to Earth Asteroids (IEOs, with orbits entirely interior to the Earth's orbit). Lastly, we have investigated the population and completion of so-called \"ARM-target\" asteroids, of size ∼10 m diameter in orbits passing within 0.03 AU of the Earth's orbit with very low Earth-encounter velocity, &lt;2.5 km/s. We find current ground-based surveys are remarkably efficient in detecting this subset of NEAs, and are currently about 1% complete, implying a total population of such bodies of only a few thousand.",

Our model indicates that ~0.1% (a factor of two uncertainty) of the steady-state NEO population (perihelion q &lt; 1.3 AU) is on retrograde orbits. These rare outcomes typically happen when asteroid orbits flip to a retrograde configuration while in the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter and then live for ~0.001 to 100 Myr. The model predicts, given the estimated near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population, that a few retrograde 0.1-1 km NEAs should exist. Currently, there are two known MPC NEOs with asteroidal designations on retrograde orbits which we therefore claim could be escaped asteroids instead of devolatilized comets. This retrograde NEA population may also answer a long-standing question in the meteoritical literature regarding the origin of high-strength, high-velocity meteoroids on retrograde orbits.",

      "abstract": "Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have struck the Earth throughout its existence. During epochs when life was gaining a foothold ∼4 Ga, the impact rate was thousands of times what it is today. Even during the Phanerozoic, the numbers of NEAs guarantee that there were other impacts, possibly larger than the Chicxulub event, which was responsible for the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions. Astronomers have found over 2500 NEAs of all sizes, including well over half of the estimated 1100 NEAs &gt;1 km diameter. NEAs are mostly collisional fragments from the inner half of the asteroid belt and range in composition from porous, carbonaceous-chondrite-like to metallic. Nearly one-fifth of them have satellites or are double bodies. When the international telescopic Spaceguard Survey, which has a goal of discovering 90% of NEAs &gt;1 km diameter, is completed, perhaps as early as 2008, nearly half of the remaining impact hazard will be from land or ocean impacts by bodies 70-600 m diameter. (Comets are expected to contribute only about 1% of the total risk.) The consequences of impacts for civilization are potentially enormous, but impacts are so rare that worldwide mortality from impacts will have dropped to only about 150 per year (averaged over very long durations) after the Spaceguard goal has, presumably, ruled out near-term impacts by 90% of the most dangerous ones; that is, in the mid-range between very serious causes of death (disease, auto accidents) and minor but frightening ones (like shark attacks). Differences in perception concerning this rather newly recognized hazard dominate evaluation of its significance. The most likely type of impact events we face are hyped or misinterpreted predicted impacts or near-misses involving small NEAs.",

From numerical integrations for 2×10 <SUP>6</SUP> years we find that the half lifetime (where the lifetime is defined against hyperbolic ejection or collision with the Sun or the planets) of near-Earth JF comets (perihelion distances q&lt;1.3 AU) is about 1.5×10 <SUP>5</SUP> years but that they spend only a small fraction of this time (∼ a few 10 <SUP>3</SUP> years) with q&lt;1.3 AU. From numerical integrations for 5×10 <SUP>6</SUP> years we find that the half lifetime of NEAs in \"cometary\" orbits (defined as those with aphelion distances Q&gt;4.5 AU, i.e., that approach or cross Jupiter's orbit) is 4.2×10 <SUP>5</SUP> years, i.e., about three times longer than that for near-Earth JF comets. We also analyze the problem of decoupling JF comets from Jupiter to produce Encke-type comets. To this end we simulate the dynamical evolution of the sample of observed JF comets with the inclusion of nongravitational forces. While decoupling occurs very seldom when a purely gravitational motion is considered, the action of nongravitational forces (as strong as or greater than those acting on Encke) can produce a few Enckes. Furthermore, a few JF comets are transferred to low-eccentricity orbits entirely within the main asteroid belt ( Q&lt;4 AU and q&gt;2 AU). The population of NEAs in cometary orbits is found to be adequately replenished with NEAs of smaller Q's diffusing outward, from which we can set an upper limit of ∼20% for the putative component of deactivated JF comets needed to maintain such a population in steady state. From this analysis, the upper limit for the average time that a JF comet in near-Earth orbit can spend as a dormant, asteroid-looking body can be estimated to be about 40% of the time spent as an active comet. More likely, JF comets in near-Earth orbits will disintegrate once (or shortly after) they end their active phases.",

Most have a chance of approximately 0.5% of colliding with the Earth in the next million years. The total number of such bodies with diameters &gt; 1 km has been estimated to be in the range 1,000-2,000, which translates to an approximately 1% chance of a catastrophic collision with the Earth in the next millennium. These numbers are, however, poorly constrained because of the limitations of previous searches using photographic plates. (One kilometre is below the size of a body whose impact on the Earth would produce global effects.) Here we report an analysis of our survey for near-Earth asteroids that uses improved detection technologies. We find that the total number of asteroids with diameters &gt; 1 km is about half the earlier estimates. At the current rate of discovery of near-Earth asteroids, 90% will probably have been detected within the next 20 years.",

The difficulty of making physical measurements for similar sized (diameter D less than 5 kilometers) main-belt asteroids and comet nuclei has limited comparative tests for distinguishing between these alternatives. A new survey of physical properties for D &lt; 5 kilometers main-belt asteroids reveals that their spin rate and shape distributions are similar to those of NEAs, as is fully consistent with a main-belt origin for most NEAs. Physical data on comet nuclei are limited. If the existing sample is representative of the comet population, analysis of the asteroid and comet samples constrains the fraction of comet nuclei to between 0 and 40 percent of the total NEA population.",

The reflectance spectra of about 100 representatives of the Aten, Apollo and Amor groups were used to determine their spectral class. For 47 asteroids such an assessment was made for the first time. For convenience, the classes were grouped into broader spectral groups (according to Tholen). The distribution by spectral groups (average 60% S-group, 20% C-group, 20% others) was consistent with results obtained previously using other data from a larger sample of objects. This distribution remains similar to what is known for NEAs of different sizes. Despite the numerical predominance of group S asteroids in the NEA data sample, asteroids of primitive types (group C) are also found at very small perihelion distances, which can indirectly confirm the widespread occurrence of the phenomenon of sublimation activity of asteroids.",

We conducted a series of optical photometric and polarimetric observations of a small NEA 2010 XC<SUB>15</SUB> in 2022 December to investigate its surface properties. The rotation period of 2010 XC<SUB>15</SUB> is possibly a few to several dozen hours and the color indices of 2010 XC<SUB>15</SUB> are derived as g - r = 0.435 ± 0.008, r - i = 0.158 ± 0.017, and r - z = 0.186 ± 0.009 in the Pan-STARRS system. The linear polarization degrees of 2010 XC<SUB>15</SUB> are a few percent at the phase angle range of 58°-114°. We found that 2010 XC<SUB>15</SUB> is a rare E-type NEA on the basis of its photometric and polarimetric properties. Taking the similarity of not only physical properties but also dynamical integrals and the rarity of E-type NEAs into account, we suppose that 2010 XC<SUB>15</SUB> and 1998 WT<SUB>24</SUB> are of common origin (i.e., an asteroid pair). These two NEAs are the sixth NEA pair and first E-type NEA pair ever confirmed, possibly formed by rotational fission. We conjecture that the parent body of 2010 XC<SUB>15</SUB> and 1998 WT<SUB>24</SUB> was transported from the main belt through the ν <SUB>6</SUB> resonance or Hungaria region.",

Photometric observations were performed using the 1.2-m telescope at the Haute-Provence observatory (France) in the BVRI filters of the Johnson-Cousins photometric systems between June 2021 and April 2022. We obtained new surface colours for 42 NEOs. Based on the measured colours, we classified 20 objects as S-complex, nine as C-complex, nine as X-complex, two as D-type, one object as V-type, and one object remained unclassified. For all the observed objects, we estimated their absolute magnitudes and diameters. Combining these new observations with the previously acquired data within the NEOROCKS project extended our data set to 93 objects. The majority of objects in the data set with diameters D &lt; 500 m belongs to a group of silicate bodies, which could be related to observational bias. Based on MOID and ΔV values we selected 14 objects that could be accessible by a spacecraft. Notably, we find D-type asteroid (163014) 2001 UA5 and A-type asteroid 2017 SE19 to be of particular interest as possible space mission targets.",

Forty six targets were not observed before our runs (88% of the sample) but some of these were targeted during the same oppositions mainly by Brian Warner. We propose new periods for 20 targets (38% of the sample), confirming published data for 20 targets, while our results for 8 targets do not match published data. We secured periods for 15 targets (29% of the sample), candidate periods for 23 objects (44%), tentative periods for 11 asteroids (21%), and have derived basic information about 3 targets (6% of the sample). We calculated the lower limit of the ellipsoid shape ratios a/b for 46 NEAs (including 13 PHAs). We confirmed or suggested 4 binary objects, recommending two of them for follow-up during future dedicated campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Phase curves of asteroids are typically considered to depend solely on the scattering properties of airless particulate surfaces and the size of the object being studied. In this study, we demonstrate the additional dependence of phase curves on object shape, rotation pole orientation, and viewing geometry over an apparition. Variations in the phase curve of near-Earth asteroid (159402) 1999 AP10 over its apparition from 2020 July to 2021 January are verified to be due to aspect changes over the apparition. This is achieved through shape modelling of the asteroid and simulation of the phase curve over the apparition. We present simulations of asteroid phase curves over a range of geometries to understand the potential magnitude of this aspect effect, and under which circumstances it can begin to dominate in the phase curves. This dependence on aspect may introduce significant additional uncertainty in the properties derived from phase-curve data. We provide and demonstrate software code to estimate the aspect-related uncertainty in near-Earth asteroid phase curves through simulation and model fitting of a randomly generated sample of ellipsoidal asteroid models over the observed viewing geometry. We demonstrate how ignoring this effect may lead to misleading interpretations of the data and underestimation of uncertainties in further studies, such as those in the infrared that use phase curve derived parameters when fitting physical properties of an asteroid.",

      "abstract": "Context. Near-earth objects (NEOs), thanks to their proximity, provide a unique opportunity to investigate asteroids with diameters down to dozens of meters. The study of NEOs is also important because of their potential hazard to the Earth. The investigation of small NEOs is challenging from Earth as they are observable only for a short time following their discovery and can sometimes only be reached again years or decades later. <BR /> Aims: We aim to derive the visible colors of NEOs and perform an initial taxonomic classification with a main focus on smaller objects and recent discoveries. <BR /> Methods: Photometric observations were performed using the 1.2 m telescope at the Haute-Provence observatory and the 1.0 m telescope at the Pic du Midi observatory in broadband Johnson-Cousins and Sloan photometric systems. <BR /> Results: We present new photometric observations for 55 NEOs. Our taxonomic classification shows that almost half (43%) of the objects in our sample are classified as S+Q-complex members, 19% as X-complex, 16% as C-complex, 12% as D-types, and finally 6% and 4% as A- and V-types, respectively. The distribution of the observed objects with H &gt; 19 and H ≤ 19 remains almost the same. However, the majority of the objects in our dataset with D &lt; 500 m belong to the \"silicate\" group, which is probably a result of an observational bias towards brighter and more accessible objects. \"Carbonaceous\" objects are predominant among those with a Jovian Tisserand parameter of Tj &lt; 3. These bodies could be dormant or extinct comets. The median values of the absolute magnitude for \"carbonaceous\" and \"silicate\" groups are H = 18.10 ± 0.95 and H = 19.50 ± 1.20, whereas the estimated median diameters are D = 1219 ± 729 m and D = 344 ± 226 m, respectively. \"Silicate\" objects have a much lower median Earth's minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) and a somewhat lower orbital inclination in comparison to \"carbonaceous\" objects. About half of the observed objects are potentially hazardous asteroids and are mostly (almost 65%) represented by \"silicate\" objects. <P />ARRAY(0x2b5f030)",

      "abstract": "Context. The population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) shows a large variety of objects in terms of physical and dynamical properties. They are subject to planetary encounters and to strong solar wind and radiation effects. Their study is also motivated by practical reasons regarding space exploration and long-term probability of impact with the Earth. <BR /> Aims: We aim to spectrally characterize a significant sample of NEAs with sizes in the range of 0.25-5.5 km (categorized as large), and search for connections between their spectral types and the orbital parameters. <BR /> Methods: Optical spectra of NEAs were obtained using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) equipped with the IDS spectrograph. These observations are analyzed using taxonomic classification and by comparison with laboratory spectra of meteorites. <BR /> Results: A total number of 76 NEAs were observed. We spectrally classified 44 of them as Q/S-complex, 16 as B/C-complex, eight as V-types, and another eight belong to the remaining taxonomic classes. Our sample contains 27 asteroids categorized as potentially hazardous and 31 possible targets for space missions including (459872) 2014 EK24, (436724) 2011 UW158, and (67367) 2000 LY27. The spectral data corresponding to (276049) 2002 CE26 and (385186) 1994 AW1 shows the 0.7 μm feature which indicates the presence of hydrated minerals on their surface. We report that Q-types have the lowest perihelia (a median value and absolute deviation of 0.797 ± 0.244 AU) and are systematically larger than the S-type asteroids observed in our sample. We explain these observational evidences by thermal fatigue fragmentation as the main process for the rejuvenation of NEA surfaces. <BR /> Conclusions: In general terms, the taxonomic distribution of our sample is similar to the previous studies and matches the broad groups of the inner main belt asteroids. Nevertheless, we found a wide diversity of spectra compared to the standard taxonomic types. <P />All optical data from INT are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/627/A124\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/627/A124</A>",

CSS has discovered 46% of the known NEO catalog, including over a third of NEOs with a diameter of approximately 140 meters or larger. Recent upgrades to both survey instruments (the 1.5 meter and Schmidt telescopes) have significantly increased CSS's annual discovery rate, which is on track to exceed 1,000 by year's end. In June, CSS also discovered another small asteroid (2018 LA) prior to Earth impact. We have also increased our focus on NEO follow-up in support of the community's discovery efforts, by remotely operating the CSS 1.0-m telescope a full 24 nights per lunation, and by operating the Steward Observatory Kuiper 61\" telescope up to 9 nights per lunation. We will discuss improvements to the planning and scheduling software, ongoing efforts to coordinate community follow-up, and progress toward reprocessing archival data and making it publicly available through NASA's Planetary Data System.

Of the 39 NEAs, 19 were targeted, but because of KMTNet’s large 2° × 2° field of view, 20 serendipitous NEAs were also captured in the observing fields. Targeted observations were performed within 44 days (median: 16 days, min: 4 days) of each NEA’s discovery date. Our broadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four asteroid taxonomies and we were able to confidently categorize 31 of the 39 observed targets as either an S-, C-, X-, or D-type asteroid by means of a Machine Learning algorithm approach. Our data suggest that the ratio between “stony” S-type NEAs and “not-stony” (C+X+D)-type NEAs, with H magnitudes between 15 and 25, is roughly 1:1. Additionally, we report ∼1 hr light curve data for each NEA, and of the 39 targets, we were able to resolve the complete rotation period and amplitude for six targets and report lower limits for the remaining targets.",

Most targets had no published data at the time of observing, but some objects were observed in the same period mainly by B. Warner, allowing us to confirm or improve the existing results. To plan the runs and select the targets, we developed the public Long Planning tool in PHP. For preliminary data reduction and rapid follow-up planning we developed the LiDAS pipeline in Python and IRAF. For final data reduction, flux calibration, night linkage and Fourier fitting, we used mainly MPO Canopus. Periods of 18 targets are presented for the first time, and we could solve or constrain rotation for 16 of them. We secured periods for 45 targets (<inline-formula id=\"IEq1\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), found candidate periods for other 16 targets (<inline-formula id=\"IEq2\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), and we propose tentative periods for other 32 targets (<inline-formula id=\"IEq3\"><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). We observed 7 known or candidate binary NEAs, fiting 3 of them (2102 Tantalus, 5143 Heracles and 68348). We observed 8 known or candidate tumbling NEAs, deriving primary periods for 3 objects (9400, 242708 and 470510). We evidenced rapid oscillations (few minutes) and could fit fast tentative periods TP2 for 5 large newly suggested tumbling or binary candidates (27346, 112985, 285625, 377732, 408980), probably discovering at least one new binary NEA (2011 WO41). We resolved periods of 4 special objects which include two proposed space mission targets (163249 and 101955 Bennu), one very fast rotator NEA discovered by EURONEAR (2014 NL52) and the \"Halloween asteroid\" (2015 TB145). Using Mercator in simultaneous 3 band MAIA imaging, we could evidence for the first time clear variation in the color lightcurves of 10 NEAs. The periods derived from the g–r color lightcurves are found to match individual band period fits for 4 NEAs (27346, 86067, 112985 and 275976).",

      "abstract": "We have carried out simulations to predict the performance of a new space-based telescopic survey operating at thermal infrared wavelengths that seeks to discover and characterize a large fraction of the potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population. Two potential architectures for the survey were considered: one located at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point, and one in a Venus-trailing orbit. A sample cadence was formulated and tested, allowing for the self-follow-up necessary for objects discovered in the daytime sky on Earth. Synthetic populations of NEAs with sizes as small as 140 m in effective spherical diameter were simulated using recent determinations of their physical and orbital properties. Estimates of the instrumental sensitivity, integration times, and slew speeds were included for both architectures assuming the properties of newly developed large-format 10 μm HgCdTe detector arrays capable of operating at ∼35 K. Our simulation included the creation of a preliminary version of a moving object processing pipeline suitable for operating on the trial cadence. We tested this pipeline on a simulated sky populated with astrophysical sources such as stars and galaxies extrapolated from Spitzer Space Telescope and Wide-field Infrared Explorer data, the catalog of known minor planets (including Main Belt asteroids, comets, Jovian Trojans, planets, etc.), and the synthetic NEA model. Trial orbits were computed for simulated position-time pairs extracted from the synthetic surveys to verify that the tested cadence would result in orbits suitable for recovering objects at a later time. Our results indicate that the Earth-Sun L1 and Venus-trailing surveys achieve similar levels of integral completeness for potentially hazardous asteroids larger than 140 m; placing the telescope in an interior orbit does not yield an improvement in discovery rates. This work serves as a necessary first step for the detailed planning of a next-generation NEA survey.",

      "abstract": "We present an approach that significantly increases the sensitivity for finding and tracking small and fast near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). This approach relies on a combined use of a new generation of high-speed cameras which allow short, high frame-rate exposures of moving objects, effectively \"freezing\" their motion, and a computationally enhanced implementation of the \"shift-and-add\" data processing technique that helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection of NEAs. The SNR of a single short exposure of a dim NEA is insufficient to detect it in one frame, but by computationally searching for an appropriate velocity vector, shifting successive frames relative to each other and then co-adding the shifted frames in post-processing, we synthetically create a long-exposure image as if the telescope were tracking the object. This approach, which we call \"synthetic tracking,\" enhances the familiar shift-and-add technique with the ability to do a wide blind search, detect, and track dim and fast-moving NEAs in near real time. We discuss also how synthetic tracking improves the astrometry of fast-moving NEAs. We apply this technique to observations of two known asteroids conducted on the Palomar 200 inch telescope and demonstrate improved SNR and 10 fold improvement of astrometric precision over the traditional long-exposure approach. In the past 5 yr, about 150 NEAs with absolute magnitudes H = 28 (~10 m in size) or fainter have been discovered. With an upgraded version of our camera and a field of view of (28 arcmin)<SUP>2</SUP> on the Palomar 200 inch telescope, synthetic tracking could allow detecting up to 180 such objects per night, including very small NEAs with sizes down to 7 m.",

      "abstract": "The near-Earth object (NEO) population, which mainly consists of fragments from collisions between asteroids in the main asteroid belt, is thought to include contributions from short-period comets as well. One of the most promising NEO candidates for a cometary origin is near-Earth asteroid (3552) Don Quixote, which has never been reported to show activity. Here we present the discovery of cometary activity in Don Quixote based on thermal-infrared observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope in its 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands. Our observations clearly show the presence of a coma and a tail in the 4.5 μm but not in the 3.6 μm band, which is consistent with molecular band emission from CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Thermal modeling of the combined photometric data on Don Quixote reveals a diameter of 18.4_{-0.4}^{+0.3} km and an albedo of 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}, which confirms Don Quixote to be the third-largest known NEO. We derive an upper limit on the dust production rate of 1.9 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and derive a CO<SUB>2</SUB> gas production rate of (1.1 ± 0.1) × 10<SUP>26</SUP> molecules s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic observations indicate the presence of fine-grained silicates, perhaps pyroxene rich, on the surface of Don Quixote. Our discovery suggests that CO<SUB>2</SUB> can be present in near-Earth space over a long time. The presence of CO<SUB>2</SUB> might also explain that Don Quixote's cometary nature remained hidden for nearly three decades.",

      "abstract": "The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program has applied electro-optical technology developed for Air Force Space Surveillance applications to the problem of discovering near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and comets. This application is natural due to the commonality between the surveillance of the sky for man-made satellites and the search for near-Earth objects (NEOs). Both require the efficient search of broad swaths of sky to detect faint, moving objects. Currently, the Air Force Ground-based Electro-Optic Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) systems, which operate as part of the worldwide U.S. space surveillance network, are being upgraded to state-of-the-art charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors. These detectors are based on recent advances made by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the fabrication of large format, highly sensitive CCDs. In addition, state-of-the-art data processing algorithms have been developed to employ the new detectors for search operations. In order to address stressing space surveillance requirements, the Lincoln CCDs have a unique combination of features, including large format, high quantum efficiency, frame transfer, high readout rate, and low noise, not found on any commercially available CCD. Systems development for the GEODSS upgrades has been accomplished at the Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site (ETS) located near Socorro, New Mexico, over the past several years. Starting in 1996, the Air Force funded a small effort to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CCD and broad area search technology when applied to the problem of finding asteroids and comets. This program evolved into the current LINEAR program, which is jointly funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA. LINEAR, which started full operations in March of 1998, has discovered through September of 1999, 257 NEAs (of 797 known to date), 11 unusual objects (of 44 known), and 32 comets. Currently, LINEAR is contributing ∼70% of the worldwide NEA discovery rate and has single-handedly increased the observations submitted to the Minor Planet Center by a factor of 10. This paper covers the technology used by the program, the operations, and the detailed results of the search efforts.",

The synodic periods in the range 2.3-230 h were detected for 25 of them; 21 periods are new and in 4 cases we confirmed earlier determinations. In 20 cases the synodic periods are interpreted as being the rotation periods. Among the 5 exceptions, in two cases there remains an uncertainty whether the detected period is not half or twice that of the rotation period, and in another two cases-(3691) 1982 FT and 1997 BR-there were found large deviations of the lightcurve points from the mean curves that can be due to possible complex rotations of the small, slowly rotating asteroids. Overall, the short period end (2.3-3.3 h) of the spin rate distribution shows characteristics that are consistent with the hypothesis of their “rubble pile” structure, as noted by Harris (LunarPlanet. Sci.XXVII, 493-494); specifically, there is a “barrier” against spins faster than 2.3 h and the amplitudes of the fast rotating NEAs are smaller in comparison with the other, longer period NEAs. In the group of slow rotators (P&gt; 12 h), the suggested presence of objects in excited rotation states must be confirmed by further observations using also different techniques. This slow rotators group may be actually more abundant than our results suggest (6 of 25 objects, i.e., 20-30%), since there is a bias against low-amplitude slow rotators in the groundbased photometric program.",

      "abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are excellent laboratories for processes that affect the surfaces of airless bodies. Most NEAs were not expected to contain OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on their surfaces because they are primarily S-complex objects and sourced from the inner Main Belt, which is interior of the frost line, and their surface temperatures are high enough to remove these volatiles. However, a 3-μm feature typically indicative of OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O was identified on other seemingly dry bodies in the inner Solar System, such as the Moon and Vesta, and more recently on the NEAs (433) Eros, (1036) Ganymed, and (3122) Florence. The most likely sources for OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on these bodies include carbonaceous chondrite impacts or interactions with protons implanted by solar wind. We investigated the causes of band depth and shape variations on NEAs by comparing new observations of Eros and Ganymed to those previously published and conducting a rotationally-resolved spectral study on Florence. All spectra discussed were collected by SpeX on NASA's IRTF using the LXD_short (1.67–4.2 μm) mode to characterize the 3-μm region. Some observations also used the prism (0.7–2.52 μm) mode to characterize asteroid spectral type and investigate silicate composition dependencies. All three asteroids possess exogenously sourced OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O and have spectra that show potential spatially correlated variations in band depth or shape. Eros' band is slightly wider at the poles than at lower sub-observer latitudes, possibly due to its high obliquity, which ensures that each polar region is oriented toward the Sun over a significant part of its orbit. Ganymed's trends in hydration band depth with sub-solar longitude and band I center suggest a carbonaceous or cometary impactor that struck the surface around 0° relative longitude, excavating a relatively magnesium- and olivine-enriched layer. Florence's total hydrogen concentration remains stable across the surface even as the OH-to-H<SUB>2</SUB>O ratio changes as the asteroid rotates. These three examples suggest that non-native OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O on other bodies will likely also be spatially dependent, regardless of delivery mechanism.",

We performed a new search for NEAs belonging to the Virginid asteroid-meteoroid complex. On the base of calculation of orbital evolution of a sample of NEAs and determination of theoretical features of related showers a search for observable active showers close to theoretically predicted ones was carried out. As a result, the predicted showers of 27 NEAs were identified with the showers of the Virginid complex.

Its low albedo and featureless B-type reflectance spectrum indicate a primitive composition, but a definitive meteorite analogue is currently indeterminate. Here we analyse a mid-infrared emissivity spectrum of Phaethon and find that it most closely matches the Yamato group (CY) of carbonaceous chondrites. The CY chondrites experienced aqueous alteration and recent thermal metamorphism in which extreme temperatures caused mineral decomposition, resulting in the production of gas species. Temperatures within Phaethon during its close approach to the Sun are conducive to the thermal decomposition of carbonates, iron sulfides and phyllosilicates that release CO<SUB>2</SUB>, S<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas, respectively. Spectral detection of these minerals strongly implies that gas release from mineral decomposition is capable of triggering dust ejection.

      "abstract": "Meteorites provide an important source of information about the formation and composition of asteroids, because the level of accuracy of studies and analyses performed in a laboratory cannot be achieved by any ground- or space-based observation. To better understand what asteroid types a meteorite represents, it is crucial to identify the body they originated from. In this paper, we aim to determine possible parent bodies for the known meteorite falls among the known population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). By using the similarity criterion D<SUB>N</SUB>, based on geocentric quantities, we found 20 possible NEA-meteorite pairs. By performing additional numerical simulations of the backward dynamics, we found that 12 of these pairs may be associated with a possible separation event from the progenitor NEA, while the remaining 8 pairs appear to be ambiguous or random associations. The most interesting are the Pribram and Neuschwanstein meteorites, which are dynamically associated with (482488) 2012 SW20 with a common separation age dating back to about 20-30 kyr ago, and the Motopi Pan meteorite, which has three candidate parent bodies: (454100) 2013 BO73, 2017 MC3, and 2009 FZ4. The average time of separation between our meteorite list and the progenitor body appears to be about 10 kyr, a time consistent with what is expected from the collision frequency of small NEAs. Based on our results, we suggest that about 25 per cent of meteorites do not originate in the main belt, but mainly from little collision events happening between NEAs in the inner Solar system.",

The shape and depth of this absorption feature vary across Bennu’s surface, spanning the range seen among similar main-belt asteroids. The distribution of the absorption feature does not correlate with temperature, reflectance, spectral slope, or hydrated minerals, although some of those characteristics correlate with each other.

This process is accompanied by a luminous phenomena in the atmosphere called bolides or fireballs. Observations of bolides provide pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites, physical and chemical properties of small asteroids, and the flux (i.e., frequency of impacts) of bodies at Earth in the centimeter to decameter size range. In this chapter we explain the processes occurring during the penetration of cosmic bodies through the atmosphere and review the methods of bolide observations. We compile available data on the fireballs associated with 22 instrumentally observed meteorite falls. Among them are the heterogeneous falls Almahata Sitta (2008 TC3) and Benešov, which revolutionized our view on the structure and composition of small asteroids; the Příbram-Neuschwanstein orbital pair, carbonaceous chondrite meteorites with orbits on the asteroid-comet boundary; and the Chelyabinsk fall, which produced a damaging blast wave. While most meteoroids disrupt into fragments during atmospheric flight, the Carancas meteoroid remained nearly intact and caused a crater-forming explosion on the ground.",

      "abstract": "Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) offer insight into a size range of objects that are not easily observed in the main asteroid belt. Previous studies on the diversity of the NEA population have relied primarily on modeling and statistical analysis to determine asteroid compositions. Olivine and pyroxene, the dominant minerals in most asteroids, have characteristic absorption features in the visible and near-infrared (VISNIR) wavelengths that can be used to determine their compositions and abundances. However, formulas previously used for deriving compositions do not work very well for ordinary chondrite assemblages. Because two-thirds of NEAs have ordinary chondrite-like spectral parameters, it is essential to determine accurate mineralogies. Here we determine the band area ratios and Band I centers of 72 NEAs with visible and near-infrared spectra and use new calibrations to derive the mineralogies 47 of these NEAs with ordinary chondrite-like spectral parameters. Our results indicate that the majority of NEAs have LL-chondrite mineralogies. This is consistent with results from previous studies but continues to be in conflict with the population of recovered ordinary chondrites, of which H chondrites are the most abundant. To look for potential correlations between asteroid size, composition, and source region, we use a dynamical model to determine the most probable source region of each NEA. Model results indicate that NEAs with LL chondrite mineralogies appear to be preferentially derived from the ν<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance. This supports the hypothesis that the Flora family, which lies near the ν<SUB>6</SUB> resonance, is the source of the LL chondrites. With the exception of basaltic achondrites, NEAs with non-chondrite spectral parameters are slightly less likely to be derived from the ν<SUB>6</SUB> resonance than NEAs with chondrite-like mineralogies. The population of NEAs with H, L, and LL chondrite mineralogies does not appear to be influenced by size, which would suggest that ordinary chondrites are not preferentially sourced from meter-sized objects due to Yarkovsky effect.",

      "abstract": "Phase reddening is an effect that produces an increase of the spectral slope and variations in the strength of the absorption bands as the phase angle increases. In order to understand its effect on spectroscopic observations of asteroids, we have analyzed the visible and near-infrared spectra (0.45-2.5 μm) of 12 near-Earth asteroids observed at different phase angles. All these asteroids are classified as either S-complex or Q-type asteroids. In addition, we have acquired laboratory spectra of three different types of ordinary chondrites at phase angles ranging from 13° to 120°. We have found that both, asteroid and meteorite spectra show an increase in band depths with increasing phase angle. In the case of the asteroids the Band I depth increases in the range of ∼2° &lt; g &lt; 70° and the Band II depth increases in the range of ∼2° &lt; g &lt; 55°. Using this information we have derived equations that can be used to correct the effect of phase reddening in the band depths. Of the three meteorite samples, the (olivine-rich) LL6 ordinary chondrite is the most affected by phase reddening. The studied ordinary chondrites have their maximum spectral contrast of Band I depths at a phase angle of ∼60°, followed by a decrease between 60° and 120° phase angle. The Band II depths of these samples have their maximum spectral contrast at phase angles of 30-60° which then gradually decreases to 120° phase angle. The spectral slope of the ordinary chondrites spectra shows a significant increase with increasing phase angle for g &gt; 30°. Variations in band centers and band area ratio (BAR) values were also found, however they seems to have no significant impact on the mineralogical analysis. Our study showed that the increase in spectral slope caused by phase reddening is comparable to certain degree of space weathering. In particular, an increase in phase angle in the range of 30-120° will produce a reddening of the reflectance spectra equivalent to exposure times of ∼0.1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP>-1.3 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> years at about 1 AU from the Sun. This increase in spectral slope due to phase reddening is also comparable to the effects caused by the addition of different fractions of SMFe. Furthermore, we found that under some circumstances phase reddening could lead to an ambiguous taxonomic classification of asteroids.",

      "abstract": "MarcoPolo-R is a sample return mission to a primitive Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) proposed in collaboration with NASA. It will rendezvous with a primitive NEA, scientifically characterize it at multiple scales, and return a unique sample to Earth unaltered by the atmospheric entry process or terrestrial weathering. MarcoPolo-R will return bulk samples (up to 2 kg) from an organic-rich binary asteroid to Earth for laboratory analyses, allowing us to: explore the origin of planetary materials and initial stages of habitable planet formation; identify and characterize the organics and volatiles in a primitive asteroid; understand the unique geomorphology, dynamics and evolution of a binary NEA. This project is based on the previous Marco Polo mission study, which was selected for the Assessment Phase of the first round of Cosmic Vision. Its scientific rationale was highly ranked by ESA committees and it was not selected only because the estimated cost was higher than the allotted amount for an M class mission. The cost of MarcoPolo-R will be reduced to within the ESA medium mission budget by collaboration with APL (John Hopkins University) and JPL in the NASA program for coordination with ESA's Cosmic Vision Call. The baseline target is a binary asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, which offers a very efficient operational and technical mission profile. A binary target also provides enhanced science return. The choice of this target will allow new investigations to be performed more easily than at a single object, and also enables investigations of the fascinating geology and geophysics of asteroids that are impossible at a single object. Several launch windows have been identified in the time-span 2020-2024. A number of other possible primitive single targets of high scientific interest have been identified covering a wide range of possible launch dates. The baseline mission scenario of MarcoPolo-R to 1996 FG3 is as follows: a single primary spacecraft provided by ESA, carrying the Earth Re-entry Capsule, sample acquisition and transfer system provided by NASA, will be launched by a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Kourou into GTO and using two space segment stages. Two similar missions with two launch windows, in 2021 and 2022 and for both sample return in 2029 (with mission duration of 7 and 8 years), have been defined. Earlier or later launches, in 2020 or 2024, also offer good opportunities. All manoeuvres are carried out by a chemical propulsion system. MarcoPolo-R takes advantage of three industrial studies completed as part of the previous Marco Polo mission (see ESA/SRE (2009)3, Marco Polo Yellow Book) and of the expertise of the consortium led by Dr. A.F. Cheng (PI of the NASA NEAR Shoemaker mission) of the JHU-APL, including JPL, NASA ARC, NASA LaRC, and MIT.",

We then compare the reflectance spectra of Phaethon with all the available visible spectra of B-type asteroids belonging to the Pallas family. One last spectral comparison is then performed to search for any correspondence between Phaethon and any B-type asteroid in the main belt. Numerical simulations are also carried out to explore the dynamical connection between the orbital neighborhoods of Pallas and Phaethon. <BR /> Results: Main differences between Phaethon and Pallas lie in the visible wavelength part of their reflectance spectra. We have also found that the nine asteroids belonging to the Pallas family have visible spectra that are different from that of Pallas and strikingly similar to that of Phaethon. Spectral comparison excludes any other B-type asteroid in the main belt as a possible parent body of Phaethon. Numerical simulations establish a dynamical pathway that connects Phaethon with Pallas and its family members. <BR /> Conclusions: The spectral similarities between Phaethon and Pallas family members, together with their established dynamical connection, supports Pallas as the most likely parent body of Phaethon and therefore, the associated Geminids meteor stream. We suggest that differences in asteroid sizes are the most likely explanation for the differences in the visible reflectance spectra between Phaethon and Pallas.",

Various explanations have been proposed for the origin of these fresh surface colours, ranging from collisions to planetary encounters. Less reddened asteroids seem to cross most deeply into the terrestrial planet region, strengthening the evidence for the planetary-encounter theory, but encounter details within 10<SUP>6</SUP> years remain to be shown. Here we report that asteroids displaying unweathered spectra (so-called `Q-types') have experienced orbital intersections closer than the Earth-Moon distance within the past 5×10<SUP>5</SUP> years. These Q-type asteroids are not currently found among asteroids showing no evidence of recent close planetary encounters. Our results substantiate previous work: tidal stress, strong enough to disturb and expose unweathered surface grains, is the most likely dominant short-term asteroid resurfacing process. Although the seismology details are yet to be worked out, the identification of rapid physical processes that can produce both fresh and weathered asteroid surfaces resolves the decades-long puzzle of the difference in colour of asteroids and meteorites.",

It is generally expected that the compositions of the asteroids that are most likely to hit Earth should reflect those of the most common meteorites. Here we report that most near-Earth asteroids (including the potentially hazardous subset) have spectral properties quantitatively similar to the class of meteorites known as LL chondrites. The prominent Flora family in the inner part of the asteroid belt shares the same spectral properties, suggesting that it is a dominant source of near-Earth asteroids. The observed similarity of near-Earth asteroids to LL chondrites is, however, surprising, as this meteorite class is relatively rare (~8 per cent of all meteorite falls). One possible explanation is the role of a size-dependent process, such as the Yarkovsky effect, in transporting material from the main belt.",

      "abstract": "On February 14, 2000, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft (NEAR Shoemaker) began the first orbital study of an asteroid, the near-Earth object 433 Eros. Almost a year later, on February 12, 2001, NEAR Shoemaker completed its mission by landing on the asteroid and acquiring data from its surface. NEAR Shoemaker's intensive study has found an average density of 2.67 ± 0.03, almost uniform within the asteroid. Based upon solar fluorescence X-ray spectra obtained from orbit, the abundance of major rock-forming elements at Eros may be consistent with that of ordinary chondrite meteorites except for a depletion in S. Such a composition would be consistent with spatially resolved, visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the surface. Gamma-ray spectra from the surface show Fe to be depleted from chondritic values, but not K. Eros is not a highly differentiated body, but some degree of partial melting or differentiation cannot be ruled out. No evidence has been found for compositional heterogeneity or an intrinsic magnetic field. The surface is covered by a regolith estimated at tens of meters thick, formed by successive impacts. Some areas have lesser surface age and were apparently more recently disturbed or covered by regolith. A small center of mass offset from the center of figure suggests regionally nonuniform regolith thickness or internal density variation. Blocks have a nonuniform distribution consistent with emplacement of ejecta from the youngest large crater. Some topographic features indicate tectonic deformations. Several regional-scale linear features have related orientations, suggesting a globally consolidated internal structure. Structural control of crater shapes hints that such internal structure is pervasive. From the bulk density, inferred composition, and evidence for global structure, Eros is interpreted to be largely intact but extensively fractured.",

      "abstract": "The Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission, the first launch of NASA's Discovery Program, will be the first mission to orbit an asteroid. NEAR will make the first comprehensive scientific measurements of an asteroid's surface composition, geology, physical properties, and internal structure. NEAR launched successfully on February 17, 1996, aboard a Delta II-7925. It will orbit the 20-km-diameter near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros for about 1 year, at a minimum orbit radius of about 35 km from the center of the asteroid. The NEAR is a solar-powered, three-axis stabilized spacecraft with a launch mass including propellant of 805 kg. NEAR uses X band telemetry to the NASA Deep Space Network, with the data rates at Eros up to 8.8 kbits/s using a 34-m High Efficiency (HEF) dish, and up to 26.5 kbits/s using a 70-m dish. A solid-state recorder is accommodated with a memory capacity of 1.8 Gbytes. Attitude control is to 1.7 mrad, line-of-sight pointing stability is within 50 μrad over 1 s, and post processing attitude knowledge is within 50 μrad. NEAR accommodates 56 kg of instruments and provides them with 84 W. The instruments are a multispectral imager (MSI), a near-infrared spectrograph (NIS), an X ray/gamma ray spectrometer (XRS/GRS), a magnetometer (MAG), and a laser rangefinder (NLR), while a radio science (RS) investigation uses the coherent X band transponder. NEAR will make a flyby of the C-type asteroid 253 Mathilde in June 1997 and will rendezvous with 433 Eros in February 1999. It will execute an initial slow flyby of Eros, with a flyby speed of 5 m/s and a closest approach distance of 500 km. Subsequently, its orbit will be lowered to 35 km. The NEAR Mission Operations Center and the Science Data Center are at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The Science Data Center will maintain the entire NEAR data set on-line, and data from all instruments can be accessed by every member of the NEAR Science Team. Data, including images, are released over the Internet as soon as they are validated.",

Near-Earth asteroids were found to have spectral properties that span the range between the previously separated domains of OC meteorites and the most common (S class) asteroids, suggesting a link. This range of spectral properties could arise through a diversity of mineralogies and regolith particle sizes, as well as through a time-dependent surface weathering process.",

      "abstract": "Near-earth asteroids occur in three principle types of orbits: Amor, Apollo, and Aten. Amor asteroids make relatively close (within 0.3 AU) approaches to the earth's orbit, but do not actually overlap it. Apollo asteroids spend most of their time outside the earth's orbital path, but at some point of close approach to the sun, they cross the orbit of the earth. Aten asteroids are those whose orbits remain inside the earth's path for the majority of their time, with semi-major axes less than 0.1 AU. Near-earth orbit asteroids include: stones, stony-irons, irons, carbonaceous, and super-carbonaceous. Metals within these asteroids include: iron, nickel, cobalt, the platinum group, aluminum, titanium, and others. Focus is on the extraction of ferrous and platinum group metals from the stony-iron asteroids, and the iron asteroids. Extraction of the metal fraction can be accomplished through the use of tunnel-boring-machines (TBM) in the case of the stony-irons. The metals within the story-iron asteroids occur as dispersed granules, which can be separated from the stony fraction through magnetic and gaseous digestion separation techniques. The metal asteroids are processes by drilling and gaseous digestion or by gaseous digestion alone. Manufacturing of structures, housings, framing networks, pressure vessels, mirrors, and other products is accomplished through the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of metal coating on advanced composites and on the inside of contour-defining inflatables (CDI). Metal coatings on advanced composites provide: resistance to degradation in the hostile environments of space; superior optical properties; superior heat dissipation; service as wear coatings; and service as evidential coatings. Metal coatings on the inside of CDI produce metal load-bearing products. Fibers such as graphite, kevlar, glass, ceramic, metal, etc., can be incorporated in the metal coatings on the inside of CDI producing metal matrix products which exhibit high strength and resist crack propagation.",

The mineralogy and petrology of 17 near-Earth asteroids are characterized using reflectance spectroscopy with ground-based telescopes as one method to address their major issues. Implications for the origin and evolution are discussed in a separate paper. Assuming the surfaces are composed of cosmically abundant materials, the presence of certain mineralogical species can be determined from diagnostic absorption features and spectral characteristics which have been studied under known laboratory conditions and understood in terms of crystal field theory. With one possible exception, the surface composition of near-Earth asteroids consists of common rock-forming minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, and phyllosilicates. Opaque components are present but cannot be mineralogically identified with existing experimental data. The spectrum of 2201 Oljato cannot be interpreted in terms of common rock-forming minerals. This spectrum was examined for cometary features because its high orbital eccentricity suggests a possible relation to comets. No common cometary features are identified in its spectrum. The predominance of mafic silicate absorption features in spectra of near-Earth asteroids compared to the majority of main-belt asteroids may be a primary compositional feature or may be the signature of relatively fresher asteroid material.",

We further implement models that incorporate these explanations into their training process and output them at test time.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software engineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional LLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code quality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for specific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving contexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and executing workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce RefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software refactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning, executing, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection and tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java projects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a search-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our assessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software quality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the contribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that RefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a median of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a median of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and the search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a median F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent approaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the median compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise of multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.",

For flexibility, agentic RAG employs autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed. Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively.

      "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents have exhibited strong problem-solving competence across domains like research and coding. Yet, it remains underexplored whether LLM agents can tackle compounding real-world problems that require a diverse set of tools to complete. Given a broad, heterogeneous tool repository, LLM agents must not only select appropriate tools based on task planning analysis but also strategically schedule the execution order to ensure efficiency. This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of LLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling. TPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a tool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools. In particular, each task is composed of multiple subtasks, such as web search, map navigation, calendar checking, etc., and each subtask can be completed by a basic tool. Our evaluation emphasizes both task completion rate and efficiency. The empirical studies on popular closed-source and open-source LLMs indicate that most models can perform reasonable tool planning, but differ in scheduling. For example, GLM-4.5 achieves an outperforming task completion rate of 64.72% with extensive sequential tool calls, hence suffering from significantly long execution time. By contrast, GPT-4o prioritizes parallel tool calls but achieves only a 45.08% completion rate. Considering reinforcement learning (RL) can be a viable way to improve the scheduling efficiency without compromising performance, we perform an initial study on Qwen3-1.7B and witness a 14% reduction in execution time alongside a 6% gain in task completion rate based on rarely 100 RL training samples.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the effective search space and accelerating training lies in symbolic equivalence: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\\log(x_1^2)+\\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\\log(x_1)+3\\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates equality graphs (e-graphs) into diverse symbolic regression algorithms, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module, enabling more efficient learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalence classes in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Under mild assumptions, we show that embedding e-graphs tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances multiple baselines across challenging benchmarks, discovering equations with lower normalized mean squared error than state-of-the-art methods.

This paper presents \\textbf{SemanticForge}, which introduces four fundamental algorithmic advances for semantically-aware code generation: (1) a novel automatic reconciliation algorithm for dual static-dynamic knowledge graphs, unifying compile-time and runtime program semantics; (2) a neural approach that learns to generate structured graph queries from natural language, achieving 73\\% precision versus 51\\% for traditional retrieval; (3) a novel beam search algorithm with integrated SMT solving, enabling real-time constraint verification during generation rather than post-hoc validation; and (4) an incremental maintenance algorithm that updates knowledge graphs in $O(|∆R| \\cdot \\log n)$ time while maintaining semantic equivalence.",

      "abstract": "Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

Inspired by bug bounties, bias bounties have been proposed as a reward-based method that involves communities in AI bias detection by asking users of AI systems to report biases they encounter when interacting with such systems. In the absence of a state-of-the-art review, this survey aimed to identify and analyse existing AI bias bounty programmes and to present academic literature on bias bounties. Google, Google Scholar, PhilPapers, and IEEE Xplore were searched, and five bias bounty programmes, as well as five research publications, were identified. All bias bounties were organised by U.S.-based organisations as time-limited contests, with public participation in four programmes and prize pools ranging from 7,000 to 24,000 USD. The five research publications included a report on the application of bug bounties to algorithmic harms, an article addressing Twitter's bias bounty, a proposal for bias bounties as an institutional mechanism to increase AI scrutiny, a workshop discussing bias bounties from queer perspectives, and an algorithmic framework for bias bounties. We argue that reducing the technical requirements to enter bounty programmes is important to include those without coding experience. Given the limited adoption of bias bounties, future efforts should explore the transferability of the best practices from bug bounties and examine how such programmes can be designed to be sensitive to underrepresented groups while lowering adoption barriers for organisations.",

Users specify the input domain for their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the expected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then searches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test function. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python modules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these tests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the developer. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular Python packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after manual review that 56\\% were valid bugs and 32\\% were valid bugs that we would report to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface high-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring bugs, 86\\% were valid and 81\\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure modes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache implementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and cloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully. Our results suggest that LLMs with PBT provides a rigorous and scalable method for autonomously testing software. Our code and artifacts are available at: https://github.com/mmaaz-git/agentic-pbt.",

      "abstract": "Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching, and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors: Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA, WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.",

We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST) structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs, where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch, and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\\% exact match and 93\\% recall on held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\\% recall, showing scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based code intelligence.",

Current solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation, either rely on imprecise similarity-based searches or demand the creation of costly, language-specific static analysis pipelines. To address this gap, we present LSPRAG, a framework for concise-context retrieval tailored for real-time, language-agnostic unit test generation.

By reusing mature LSP servers, LSPRAG provides an LLM with language-aware context retrieval, requiring minimal per-language engineering effort. We evaluated LSPRAG on open-source projects spanning Java, Go, and Python. Compared to the best performance of baselines, LSPRAG increased line coverage by up to 174.55% for Golang, 213.31% for Java, and 31.57% for Python.",

But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.",

The framework builds a unified knowledge graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines.

Our evaluation metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy, allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings, fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs, enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts. Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost, highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. &lt;=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 78.0% and 34.3% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 100 turns and output tokens exceeding 400k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 51.1 on xBench and 58.7 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. Finally, we also show that ASearcher-Web-QwQ could achieve performance of commercial systems using external summary tool in a zero-shot transfer manner and test-time search. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.",

AlphaEvolve orchestrates an autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google, AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers, found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \\times 4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting. We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and computation.",

However, despite their extensive knowledge and ability to produce high-quality code, LLMs often struggle with contextual accuracy, particularly in evolving codebases. Current code search and retrieval methods frequently lack robustness in both the quality and contextual relevance of retrieved results, leading to suboptimal code generation. This paper introduces a novel knowledge graph-based approach to improve code search and retrieval leading to better quality of code generation in the context of repository-level tasks. The proposed approach represents code repositories as graphs, capturing structural and relational information for enhanced context-aware code generation. Our framework employs a hybrid approach for code retrieval to improve contextual relevance, track inter-file modular dependencies, generate more robust code and ensure consistency with the existing codebase. We benchmark the proposed approach on the Evolutionary Code Benchmark (EvoCodeBench) dataset, a repository-level code generation benchmark, and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approach. These findings suggest that knowledge graph based code generation could advance robust, context-sensitive coding assistance tools.",

Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10).

      "abstract": "Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\\% and 44.6\\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\\%--30.5\\%.",

One approach is to add the entire repo to the LLM's context window. However, most tasks involve only fraction of symbols from a repo, longer contexts are detrimental to the LLM's reasoning abilities, and context windows are not unlimited. Alternatively, we could emulate the human ability to navigate a large repo, pick out the right functionality, and form a plan to solve the task. We propose MutaGReP (Mutation-guided Grounded Repository Plan Search), an approach to search for plans that decompose a user request into natural language steps grounded in the codebase. MutaGReP performs neural tree search in plan space, exploring by mutating plans and using a symbol retriever for grounding. On the challenging LongCodeArena benchmark, our plans use less than 5% of the 128K context window for GPT-4o but rival the coding performance of GPT-4o with a context window filled with the repo. Plans produced by MutaGReP allow Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B and 72B to match the performance of GPT-4o with full repo context and enable progress on the hardest LongCodeArena tasks.

If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and the human design of a suitable search space. The Gödel machine proposed a theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent. This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management, peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to 50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless innovation.",

Six weeks ago, I joined GitLab’s Growth team as a fullstack engineer.

Also, in line with GitLab's values, my team encouraged me to start contributing right away. I quickly realized that onboarding here is both diligent and intense. Luckily, I had a secret helper: <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/\">GitLab Duo</a>.</p>\n<h2>My main use cases</h2>\n<p>I’ve found GitLab Duo's AI assistance, available throughout the software development lifecycle, useful in three key areas: exploration, reviewing, and debugging. With GitLab Duo, I was able to get my first tiny MR deployed to production in the first week and actively contribute to <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2025/10/16/gitlab-18-5-released/#pick-up-where-you-left-off-on-the-new-personal-homepage\">the personal homepage</a> in GitLab 18.5 in the weeks after.</p>\n<h3>Exploration</h3>\n<p>Early in onboarding, I often remembered reading something but couldn’t recall where. GitLab has a <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/\">public-facing handbook</a>, an internal handbook, and <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/\">GitLab Docs</a>. It can be difficult to search across all of them efficiently.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo simplifies this task: I can describe what I’m looking for in natural language via <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/\">GitLab Duo Chat</a> and search across all resources at once.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I remember reading about how RSpec tests are done at GitLab.

GitLab Duo will relate the requirements of the issue against the whole GitLab codebase, assess similar features, and prepare all the findings. Based on its output I am able to refine the issue with my product manager and designer, and make sure my implementation covers all edge cases or define future iterations.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Analyze this issue in the context of its epic and identify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation questions to ask PM/design before coding</li>\n<li>Edge cases not covered in requirements</li>\n<li>Cross-feature dependencies that might be affected</li>\n<li>Missing acceptance criteria</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also check that my planned solution follows GitLab best practices and common patterns.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to implement XZY behavior — how is this usually done at GitLab, and what other options do I have?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Reviewing</h3>\n<p>I always <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/duo_in_merge_requests/#have-gitlab-duo-review-your-code\">let GitLab Duo review my merge requests</a> before assigning human reviewers. It often catches small mistakes, suggests improvements, and highlights edge cases I missed. This shortens the review cycle and helps my teammates focus on more complex and bigger-picture feedback.</p>\n<p>Since I’m still new to GitLab’s codebase and coding practices, some review comments are hard to interpret. In those cases, GitLab Duo helps me understand what a reviewer means and how it relates to my code.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t understand the comment on this MR about following the user instead of testing component internals, what does it mean and how does it relate to my implementation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Debugging</h3>\n<p>Sometimes pipeline tests on my merge requests failed unexpectedly. If I can’t tell whether my changes are the cause, GitLab Duo helps me investigate and fix the failures. Using <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo_chat/agentic_chat/\">GitLab Duo Agentic Chat</a>, Duo can apply changes to debug the failing job.</p>\n<p>Example prompt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pipeline job “rspec system pg16 12/32” is failing, but I don’t know whether that relates to my changes. Can you check, if my changes are causing the pipeline failure and, if so, guide me through the steps of fixing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How Duo aligns with GitLab’s values</h2>\n<p>Using GitLab Duo doesn’t just help me, it also supports <a href=\"https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/\">GitLab’s CREDIT values</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I ask teammates fewer basic questions. And when I do ask questions, they’re more thoughtful and informed.

It can be a powerful tool, but AI does get things wrong. Therefore, I avoid <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02422-7\">automation bias</a> by always validating AI's outputs. If I don’t understand the output, I don’t use it.\nI’m also cautious of over-reliance. Studies suggest that heavy AI use can lead to <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6\">cognitive offloading</a> and worse outcomes in the long run. One study shows that users of AI <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19699?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">perform worse in exams</a>. To avoid negatively affecting my skills, I use AI as a discussion partner rather than just implementing the code it generates.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Onboarding is always a stressful time, but using GitLab Duo made mine smoother and less overwhelming.

      "summary": "For Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies, the U.S. Department of Defense's release of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Final Rule and new guidance on “FedRAMP equivalency” has dramatically increased the cost of compliance and fundamentally changed the way in which they drive their risk management programs. Gone is the era of “self-attestation” of security programs; DIB companies are required to strictly apply NIST 800-171 to their environments that handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), and have their security controls audited by a Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) every three years.\nDIB companies are engineering focused, not compliance driven, and formal audits get pricey quickly.

GitLab Dedicated for Government's FedRAMP Moderate Authorization means DIB companies can directly use GitLab Dedicated for Government with no additional audits or authorizations, which reduces the impact and cost of compliance.\nThe foundational rule: FedRAMP Moderate Equivalency\nThe protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within the DIB is driven by a foundational legal and contractual mandate: the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Clause 252.204-7012.

      "content": "<p>Building <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/agent-platform/\">AI agents</a> is</p>\n<p>exciting, but deploying them securely to production shouldn't be</p>\n<p>complicated. In this tutorial, you will learn how GitLab's <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/understand-the-google-cloud-gitlab-integration\">native Google Cloud integration</a> makes it straightforward to deploy AI agents to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) — with built-in scanning and zero service account keys.</p>\n<h2>Why choose GKE to deploy your AI agents?</h2>\n<p>GKE provides enterprise-grade orchestration that connects seamlessly with GitLab CI/CD pipelines through OIDC authentication. Your development team can deploy AI agents while maintaining complete visibility, compliance, and control over your cloud infrastructure. This guide uses Google's Agent Development Kit (<a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agent-development-kit-easy-to-build-multi-agent-applications/\">ADK</a>) to build the app, so you can expect increased seamlessness as this is deployed using GitLab.</p>\n<p>Three key advantages to this approach:</p>\n<p><strong>Full infrastructure control</strong> - Your data, your rules, your environment. You maintain complete control over where your AI agents run and how they're configured.</p>\n<p><strong>Native GitLab integration</strong> - No complex workarounds. Your existing pipelines work right out of the box thanks to GitLab's native integration with Google Cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Production-grade scaling</strong> - GKE automatically handles the heavy lifting of scaling and internal orchestration as your AI workloads grow.</p>\n<p>The key point is that GitLab with GKE provides the enterprise reliability your AI deployments demand without sacrificing the developer experience your teams expect.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Before you start, make sure you have these APIs enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GKE API</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact Registry API</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Vertex AI API</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also make sure you have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GitLab project created</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GKE cluster provisioned</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Artifact Registry repository created</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The deployment process</h2>\n<h3>1. Set up IAM and permissions on GitLab</h3>\n<p>Navigate to your GitLab integrations to configure Google Cloud authentication (IAM).</p>\n<p>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Integrations</strong> and configure the Google Cloud integration. If you're using a group-level integration, notice that default settings are already inherited by projects. This means you configure once at the group level, and all projects benefit and inherit this setting.</p>\n<p>To set this up from scratch, provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Project ID</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project Number</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Workload Identity Pool ID</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provider ID</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once configured, GitLab provides a script to run in Google Cloud Console, via Cloud Shell. The outcome of running this script is a Workload Identity Federation pool with the necessary service principal to enable the proper access.</p>\n<h3>2. Configure Artifact Registry integration</h3>\n<p>Still in GitLab's integration settings, configure Artifact Management:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Artifact Management</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select <strong>Google Artifact Registry</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project ID</li>\n<li>Repository Name (created beforehand)</li>\n<li>Repository Location</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>GitLab provides another script to run in Google Cloud Console.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before proceeding, add these extra roles to the Workload Identity Federation pool:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Service Account User</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes Developer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kubernetes Cluster Viewer</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These permissions allow GitLab to deploy to GKE in subsequent steps.</p>\n<h3>3. Create the CI/CD pipeline</h3>\n<p>Now for the key part — creating the CI/CD pipeline for deployment.</p>\n<p>Head to <strong>Build &gt; Pipeline Editor</strong> and define your pipeline with four stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build</strong> - Docker creates the container image.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test</strong> - GitLab Auto DevOps provides built-in security scans to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Upload</strong> - Uses GitLab's built-in CI/CD component to push to Google Artifact Registry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deploy</strong> - Uses Kubernetes configuration to deploy to GKE.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's the complete <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">\n\ndefault:\n  tags: [ saas-linux-2xlarge-amd64 ]\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - upload\n  - deploy\n\nvariables:\n  GITLAB_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  AR_IMAGE: $GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_PROJECT_ID/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_NAME/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  GCP_PROJECT_ID: &quot;your-project-id&quot;\n  GKE_CLUSTER: &quot;your-cluster&quot;\n  GKE_REGION: &quot;us-central1&quot;\n  KSA_NAME: &quot;ai-agent-ksa&quot;\n\nbuild:\n  image: docker:24.0.5\n  stage: build\n  services:\n    - docker:24.0.5-dind\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $GITLAB_IMAGE .\n    - docker push $GITLAB_IMAGE\n\ninclude:\n  - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - component: gitlab.com/google-gitlab-components/artifact-registry/upload-artifact-registry@main\n    inputs:\n      stage: upload\n      source: $GITLAB_IMAGE\n      target: $AR_IMAGE\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  image: google/cloud-sdk:slim\n  identity: google_cloud\n  before_script:\n    - apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y kubectl google-cloud-sdk-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin\n    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_CLUSTER --region $GKE_REGION --project $GCP_PROJECT_ID\n  script:\n    - |\n      kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF\n      apiVersion: apps/v1\n      kind: Deployment\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        replicas: 2\n        selector:\n          matchLabels:\n            app: ai-agent\n        template:\n          metadata:\n            labels:\n              app: ai-agent\n          spec:\n            serviceAccountName: $KSA_NAME\n            containers:\n            - name: ai-agent\n              image: $AR_IMAGE\n              ports:\n              - containerPort: 8080\n              resources:\n                requests: {cpu: 500m, memory: 1Gi}\n                limits: {cpu: 2000m, memory: 4Gi}\n              livenessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 60\n              readinessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 30\n      ---\n      apiVersion: v1\n      kind: Service\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-service\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        type: LoadBalancer\n        ports:\n        - port: 80\n          targetPort: 8080\n        selector:\n          app: ai-agent\n      ---\n      apiVersion: autoscaling/v2\n      kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-hpa\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        scaleTargetRef:\n          apiVersion: apps/v1\n          kind: Deployment\n          name: ai-agent\n        minReplicas: 2\n        maxReplicas: 10\n        metrics:\n        - type: Resource\n          resource:\n            name: cpu\n            target: {type: Utilization, averageUtilization: 70}\n      EOF\n      \n      kubectl rollout status deployment/ai-agent -n default --timeout=5m\n      EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service ai-agent-service -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')\n      echo &quot;Deployed at: http://$EXTERNAL_IP&quot;\n  only:\n    - main\n</code></pre>\n<h4>The critical configuration for GKE</h4>\n<p>What makes this work — and why we need this extra configuration for GKE— is that we must have a Kubernetes Service Account in the cluster that can work with Vertex AI.

Create the CI/CD pipeline\nNow for the key part — creating the CI/CD pipeline for deployment.\nHead to Build > Pipeline Editor and define your pipeline with four stages:\nBuild - Docker creates the container image.\nTest - GitLab Auto DevOps provides built-in security scans to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.\nUpload - Uses GitLab's built-in CI/CD component to push to Google Artifact Registry.\nDeploy - Uses Kubernetes configuration to deploy to GKE.\nHere's the complete .gitlab-ci.yml:\n\n\ndefault:\n  tags: [ saas-linux-2xlarge-amd64 ]\n\nstages:\n  - build\n  - test\n  - upload\n  - deploy\n\nvariables:\n  GITLAB_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  AR_IMAGE: $GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_PROJECT_ID/$GOOGLE_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPOSITORY_NAME/main:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA\n  GCP_PROJECT_ID: \"your-project-id\"\n  GKE_CLUSTER: \"your-cluster\"\n  GKE_REGION: \"us-central1\"\n  KSA_NAME: \"ai-agent-ksa\"\n\nbuild:\n  image: docker:24.0.5\n  stage: build\n  services:\n    - docker:24.0.5-dind\n  before_script:\n    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY\n  script:\n    - docker build -t $GITLAB_IMAGE .\n    - docker push $GITLAB_IMAGE\n\ninclude:\n  - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - template: Jobs/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml\n  - component: gitlab.com/google-gitlab-components/artifact-registry/upload-artifact-registry@main\n    inputs:\n      stage: upload\n      source: $GITLAB_IMAGE\n      target: $AR_IMAGE\n\ndeploy:\n  stage: deploy\n  image: google/cloud-sdk:slim\n  identity: google_cloud\n  before_script:\n    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubectl google-cloud-sdk-gke-gcloud-auth-plugin\n    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_CLUSTER --region $GKE_REGION --project $GCP_PROJECT_ID\n  script:\n    - |\n      kubectl apply -f - <<EOF\n      apiVersion: apps/v1\n      kind: Deployment\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        replicas: 2\n        selector:\n          matchLabels:\n            app: ai-agent\n        template:\n          metadata:\n            labels:\n              app: ai-agent\n          spec:\n            serviceAccountName: $KSA_NAME\n            containers:\n            - name: ai-agent\n              image: $AR_IMAGE\n              ports:\n              - containerPort: 8080\n              resources:\n                requests: {cpu: 500m, memory: 1Gi}\n                limits: {cpu: 2000m, memory: 4Gi}\n              livenessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 60\n              readinessProbe:\n                httpGet: {path: /health, port: 8080}\n                initialDelaySeconds: 30\n      ---\n      apiVersion: v1\n      kind: Service\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-service\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        type: LoadBalancer\n        ports:\n        - port: 80\n          targetPort: 8080\n        selector:\n          app: ai-agent\n      ---\n      apiVersion: autoscaling/v2\n      kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\n      metadata:\n        name: ai-agent-hpa\n        namespace: default\n      spec:\n        scaleTargetRef:\n          apiVersion: apps/v1\n          kind: Deployment\n          name: ai-agent\n        minReplicas: 2\n        maxReplicas: 10\n        metrics:\n        - type: Resource\n          resource:\n            name: cpu\n            target: {type: Utilization, averageUtilization: 70}\n      EOF\n      \n      kubectl rollout status deployment/ai-agent -n default --timeout=5m\n      EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service ai-agent-service -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')\n      echo \"Deployed at: http://$EXTERNAL_IP\"\n  only:\n    - main\n\nThe critical configuration for GKE\nWhat makes this work — and why we need this extra configuration for GKE— is that we must have a Kubernetes Service Account in the cluster that can work with Vertex AI. We need that service account to be permitted to access the AI capabilities of Google Cloud.\nWithout this, we can deploy the application, but the AI agent won't work. We need to create a Kubernetes Service Account that can access Vertex AI.\nRun this one-time setup:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nPROJECT_ID=\"your-project-id\"\n\n\nGSA_NAME=\"ai-agent-vertex\"\n\n\nGSA_EMAIL=\"${GSA_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com\"\n\n\nKSA_NAME=\"ai-agent-ksa\"\n\n\nCLUSTER_NAME=\"your-cluster\"\n\n\nREGION=\"us-central1\"\n\n\n\n# Create GCP Service Account\n\n\ngcloud iam service-accounts create $GSA_NAME \\\n    --display-name=\"AI Agent Vertex AI\" \\\n    --project=$PROJECT_ID\n\n# Grant Vertex AI permissions\n\n\ngcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \\\n    --member=\"serviceAccount:${GSA_EMAIL}\" \\\n    --role=\"roles/aiplatform.user\"\n\n# Get cluster credentials\n\n\ngcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME \\\n    --region $REGION --project $PROJECT_ID\n\n# Create Kubernetes Service Account\n\n\nkubectl create serviceaccount $KSA_NAME -n default\n\n\n\n# Link accounts\n\n\nkubectl annotate serviceaccount $KSA_NAME -n default \\\n    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=${GSA_EMAIL}\n\ngcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding ${GSA_EMAIL} \\\n    --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \\\n    --member=\"serviceAccount:${PROJECT_ID}.svc.id.goog[default/${KSA_NAME}]\" \\\n    --project=$PROJECT_ID\n\n4. Deploy to GKE\nOnce you're done, push this change to the pipeline and you're good to go.\nYou can see the pipeline has just deployed. Go to CI/CD > Pipelines and you'll see the four stages:\nBuild\nTest (with all defined security scans)\nUpload to Artifact Registry (successful)\nDeploy to Kubernetes in GKE (success)\nSummary\nWith GitLab and Google Cloud together, you're able to deploy your AI agent to GKE with ease and security. We didn't have to go through a lot of steps — we were able to do that thanks to GitLab's native integration with Google Cloud.\nWatch this demo:\n<!-- blank line -->\n<figure class=\"video_container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mc2pCL5Qjus?si=QoH02lvz5KH5Ku9O\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"> </iframe>\n</figure>\n<!-- blank line -->\nUse this tutorial's complete code example to get started now.

      "url": "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/delivering-faster-and-smarter-scans-with-advanced-sast/",
      "content": "<p>Static application security testing (SAST) is critical to building secure software, helping teams identify vulnerabilities in code before they can be exploited. Last year, with GitLab 17.4, we <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-advanced-sast-is-now-generally-available/\">launched Advanced SAST</a> to deliver higher-quality scan results directly in developer workflows. Since then, Advanced SAST has powered millions of scans across over a hundred thousand codebases, reducing risk and helping customers build more secure applications from the start.</p>\n<p>We’re building on that foundation with a set of performance enhancements designed to improve accuracy and speed, so developers get results they can trust, without losing their flow. <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-18-5-intelligence-that-moves-software-development-forward/\">New capabilities</a> include better out-of-the-box precision, the ability to add custom detection rules, and a trio of improvements to accelerate scan times through multi-core scanning, algorithmic optimizations, and diff-based scanning. Together, these improvements make <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/gitlab_advanced_sast/\">Advanced SAST</a> smarter and faster, delivering security that’s developer-friendly by design.</p>\n<h2>SAST adoption hinges on both accuracy and speed</h2>\n<p>Most SAST programs rarely fail due to inaccurate vulnerability detection; they fail because developers don’t adopt security tooling. Too often, AppSec solutions like SAST deliver accuracy at the expense of the developer experience, or developer experience at the expense of accuracy. In reality, both are necessary. Without accuracy, developers don’t trust the results; without speed and usability, adoption lags.</p>\n<p>When both come together, security fits naturally into the development process — and that’s the only way security teams successfully drive SAST adoption at scale. This philosophy guides the GitLab roadmap for Advanced SAST.</p>\n<h2>Add custom detection rules for greater accuracy</h2>\n<p>The built-in Advanced SAST rules are informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. Until now, you could <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/customize_rulesets/\">disable rules</a> or adjust their name, description, or severity, but you couldn’t add new detection logic. With GitLab 18.5, teams can now define their own custom, pattern-based rules to catch organization-specific issues — like flagging banned function calls — while still using GitLab’s curated ruleset as the baseline. Any violations of custom rules are reported in the same place as built-in GitLab rules, so developers can glean information from a single dashboard.</p>\n<p>Custom rules are effective at catching straightforward issues that matter to your organization, but they don’t influence the taint analysis that Advanced SAST uses to catch injections and similar flaws. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. The result is higher-quality scan results tuned to your context, giving security teams more control and developers clearer, more actionable findings.</p>\n<h2>Faster scans to get developers in the flow</h2>\n<p>Speed matters. If a SAST scan takes too long, developers often switch to another task, so adoption suffers.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’ve invested in several performance-based enhancements to dramatically reduce scan times without compromising on accuracy, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-core scanning</strong>: Leverages multiple CPU cores on GitLab Runners</li>\n<li><strong>Diff-based scanning</strong>: Scans only the changed code in a merge request</li>\n<li><strong>Ongoing optimizations</strong>: Smarter algorithms and engine enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These improvements build on each other, delivering faster scans with significant impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-core scanning typically reduces scan runtime by up to <strong>50%.</strong></li>\n<li>Diff-based scanning helps the most in large repositories, where less code is modified in each change. It’s specifically designed to give faster feedback in the code review process by delivering faster scans in merge requests. In our testing, many large repositories now take less than <strong>10 minutes to return results in MRs, where previously scans took more than 20 minutes.</strong></li>\n<li>In recent internal testing, algorithmic optimizations <strong>cut scan times by up to 71%</strong> on large open-source codebases, with Apache Lucene (Java) showing the biggest improvement. Other projects, including Django (Python), Kafka, and Zulip, also saw <strong>performance boosts of over 50% in single-core mode</strong>. You can see the results for yourself below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers, these improvements mean quicker feedback in merge requests, less waiting on security results, and a smoother path to adoption. And with multi-core scanning and diff-based analysis layered on top, the gains will be even greater.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760714805/rxl2zzo58j7y0k2ldxeq.png\" alt=\"chart showing Python scan times\">\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/about-gitlab-com/image/upload/v1760714805/hz9bsrir6nrqthkjddvi.png\" alt=\"chart showing Java scan times\"></p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These performance gains reflect GitLab’s broader focus on improving the developer experience across our platform. For example, one of our customers recently transitioned to GitLab’s <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/policies/pipeline_execution_policies/\">Pipeline Execution Policies</a> (PEP) to gain greater control and flexibility over how security scans run within their pipelines. By standardizing templates, adding caching, and optimizing pipeline logic, their teams cut dependency scan runtimes from <strong>15–60 minutes down to just 1–2 minutes per job — saving roughly 100,000 compute minutes every day across 15,000 scans</strong>. It’s a clear example of how more customizable and efficient pipeline execution policies lead to faster feedback loops, higher productivity, and broader adoption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With these latest enhancements, Advanced SAST gives security and development teams the accuracy, speed, and flexibility they need to keep up with modern software development. By reducing false positives, enabling custom detection, and accelerating scan times, we’re making security an enabler — not a blocker — for developers.</p>\n<p>Like all of <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/application-security-testing/\">GitLab’s application security capabilities</a>, Advanced SAST is built directly into our DevSecOps platform, making security a natural part of how developers build, test, deploy, and secure software.</p>\n<p>The result: faster adoption, fewer bottlenecks, and more secure applications delivered from the start.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get started with Advanced SAST today!

This philosophy guides the GitLab roadmap for Advanced SAST.\nAdd custom detection rules for greater accuracy\nThe built-in Advanced SAST rules are informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. Until now, you could disable rules or adjust their name, description, or severity, but you couldn’t add new detection logic. With GitLab 18.5, teams can now define their own custom, pattern-based rules to catch organization-specific issues — like flagging banned function calls — while still using GitLab’s curated ruleset as the baseline. Any violations of custom rules are reported in the same place as built-in GitLab rules, so developers can glean information from a single dashboard.\nCustom rules are effective at catching straightforward issues that matter to your organization, but they don’t influence the taint analysis that Advanced SAST uses to catch injections and similar flaws. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. The result is higher-quality scan results tuned to your context, giving security teams more control and developers clearer, more actionable findings.\nFaster scans to get developers in the flow\nSpeed matters. If a SAST scan takes too long, developers often switch to another task, so adoption suffers.\nThat’s why we’ve invested in several performance-based enhancements to dramatically reduce scan times without compromising on accuracy, including:\nMulti-core scanning: Leverages multiple CPU cores on GitLab Runners\nDiff-based scanning: Scans only the changed code in a merge request\nOngoing optimizations: Smarter algorithms and engine enhancements\nThese improvements build on each other, delivering faster scans with significant impact:\nMulti-core scanning typically reduces scan runtime by up to 50%.\nDiff-based scanning helps the most in large repositories, where less code is modified in each change. It’s specifically designed to give faster feedback in the code review process by delivering faster scans in merge requests. In our testing, many large repositories now take less than 10 minutes to return results in MRs, where previously scans took more than 20 minutes.\nIn recent internal testing, algorithmic optimizations cut scan times by up to 71% on large open-source codebases, with Apache Lucene (Java) showing the biggest improvement. Other projects, including Django (Python), Kafka, and Zulip, also saw performance boosts of over 50% in single-core mode. You can see the results for yourself below.\nFor developers, these improvements mean quicker feedback in merge requests, less waiting on security results, and a smoother path to adoption. And with multi-core scanning and diff-based analysis layered on top, the gains will be even greater.\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\nThese performance gains reflect GitLab’s broader focus on improving the developer experience across our platform. For example, one of our customers recently transitioned to GitLab’s Pipeline Execution Policies (PEP) to gain greater control and flexibility over how security scans run within their pipelines. By standardizing templates, adding caching, and optimizing pipeline logic, their teams cut dependency scan runtimes from 15–60 minutes down to just 1–2 minutes per job — saving roughly 100,000 compute minutes every day across 15,000 scans. It’s a clear example of how more customizable and efficient pipeline execution policies lead to faster feedback loops, higher productivity, and broader adoption.\nWith these latest enhancements, Advanced SAST gives security and development teams the accuracy, speed, and flexibility they need to keep up with modern software development. By reducing false positives, enabling custom detection, and accelerating scan times, we’re making security an enabler — not a blocker — for developers.\nLike all of GitLab’s application security capabilities, Advanced SAST is built directly into our DevSecOps platform, making security a natural part of how developers build, test, deploy, and secure software.\nThe result: faster adoption, fewer bottlenecks, and more secure applications delivered from the start.\nGet started with Advanced SAST today!

Duo Planner acts as your teammate with awareness of your project context, including how you manage issues, epics, and merge requests. Unlike generic AI assistants, it's purpose-built with deep knowledge of GitLab's planning workflows coupled with Agile and prioritization frameworks to help you balance effort, risk, and strategic alignment.</p>\n<p>GitLab Duo Planner can turn vague ideas into structured planning hierarchies, identify stale backlog items, and draft executive updates. For example, when refining your backlog with hundreds of issues accumulated over months, simply prompt: &quot;Identify stale backlog items and suggest priorities.&quot; Within seconds, you'll receive a structured summary showing issues without recent activity, items missing key details, duplicate work, and recommended priorities based on labels and milestones, complete with actionable recommendations.</p>\n<p>For teams managing complex roadmaps, the Planner aims to eliminate hours of manual analysis and context-switching, helping Product Managers and engineering leads make faster, more informed decisions. As of 18.5, GitLab Duo Planner is currently “read-only,” meaning that it can analyze, plan, and suggest, but cannot yet take direct action to modify anything. Please see our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agents/foundational_agents/planner/\">documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Extensible Agent Catalog: Popular AI tools as native GitLab agents</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 introduces popular AI agents directly into the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/ai_catalog/\">AI Catalog</a>, making external tools like Claude, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer, and OpenCode available as native GitLab agents. Users can now discover, configure, and deploy these agents through the same unified catalog interface used for GitLab's built-in agents, with automatic syncing of foundational agents across organization catalogs.</p>\n<p>This eliminates the complexity of manual agent setup by providing a point-and-click catalog experience while maintaining enterprise-grade security through GitLab's authentication and audit systems. GitLab Duo Enterprise subscriptions now include built-in usage of Claude and Codex within GitLab, allowing you to use your existing GitLab subscription for these tools without requiring separate API keys or additional billing setup. Other agents may still require separate subscriptions and configuration while we finalize our integration plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-hosted GitLab Duo Agent Platform (Beta): Address data sovereignty requirements without sacrificing AI power</strong></p>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 moves GitLab Duo Agent Platform's self-hosted capabilities from experimental to beta, enabling organizations to execute AI agents and flows entirely within their own infrastructure — critical for regulated industries and data sovereignty requirements. The beta release includes improved timeout configurations and AI Gateway settings, allowing teams to use AI agents for code reviews, bug fixes, and feature implementations, while providing enterprise-grade security for sensitive code.</p>\n<h2>Smarter, faster security: Prioritize real risks and keep developers in the flow</h2>\n<p>GitLab 18.5 introduces new application security capabilities that help teams focus on exploitable risk, reduce noise, and strengthen software supply chain security. These updates continue our commitment to building security directly into the development process — delivering precision, speed, and insight without disrupting developer flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Static Reachability Analysis</strong></p>\n<p>With over <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/\">37,000 new CVEs</a> issued this year, security teams face an overwhelming volume of vulnerabilities and struggle to understand which ones are truly exploitable. Static Reachability Analysis, now in limited availability, brings library-level precision by helping to identify whether vulnerable code is actually invoked in your application, not just present in dependencies.</p>\n<p>Paired with our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/risk_assessment_data/\">recently released</a> Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) and Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) data, security teams can more effectively accelerate vulnerability triage and prioritize real risks to help strengthen overall supply chain security. In 18.5, we’re adding support for Java, alongside existing support for Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Validity Checks</strong></p>\n<p>Just as Static Reachability Analysis helps teams prioritize exploitable vulnerabilities from open source dependencies, Secret Validity Checks bring the same insight to exposed secrets — currently available in beta on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed. For GitLab-issued security tokens, instead of manually verifying whether a leaked credential or API key is active, GitLab automatically distinguishes active secrets from expired ones directly in the <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/\">Vulnerability Report</a>. This helps enable security and development teams to focus remediation efforts on genuine risks. Support for AWS- and GCP-issued secrets is planned for future releases.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom rules for Advanced SAST</strong></p>\n<p>Advanced SAST runs on rules informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. However, some teams required additional flexibility to tune the SAST engine for their specific organization. With Custom Rules for Advanced SAST, AppSec teams can define atomic, pattern-based detection logic to help capture security issues specific to their organization — like flagging banned function calls — while still using GitLab’s curated ruleset as the baseline. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. While these rules will not support taint analysis, they do give organizations greater flexibility in achieving accurate SAST results.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced SAST C and C++ language support</strong></p>\n<p>We’re expanding our language coverage for Advanced SAST to include C and C++, which are widely used languages in embedded systems software development. To enable scanning, projects must generate a compilation database that captures compiler commands and includes paths used during builds. This works to ensure the scanner can accurately parse and analyze source files, delivering precise, context-aware results that help security teams identify real vulnerabilities in the development process. The implementation requirements for C and C++ require specific configurations, which can be found in our <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/user/application_security/sast/cpp_advanced_sast/\">documentation</a>. Advanced SAST C and C++ support are currently available in beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Diff-based SAST scanning</strong></p>\n<p>Traditional SAST scans re-analyze entire codebases with every commit, slowing pipelines and disrupting developer flow. The developer experience is a critical consideration that can make or break the adoption of application security testing. Diff-based SAST scanning aims to speed up scan times by focusing only on the code changed in a merge request, reducing redundant analysis and surfacing relevant results tied to the developer’s work. By aligning scans with actual code changes, GitLab delivers faster, more focused feedback that helps keep developers in flow while maintaining strong security coverage.</p>\n<h2>Simplify API configurations</h2>\n<p>API-driven workflows offer power and flexibility, but they can also create unnecessary complexity for tasks that teams need to perform regularly. The new Maven Virtual Registry interface brings a UI layer to these operations.</p>\n<h3>Maven Virtual Registry interface</h3>\n<p>The new web-based interface for managing Maven Virtual Registries turns complex API configurations into visual simplicity, providing a more intuitive experience for package administrators and platform engineers.</p>\n<p>Previously, teams configured and maintained virtual registries only through API calls, which made routine maintenance time-consuming and required specialized platform knowledge. The new interface removes that barrier, helping to make everyday tasks faster and easier.</p>\n<p>With this update, you can now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create virtual registries to simplify dependency configuration</li>\n<li>Create and order upstreams to help improve performance and compliance</li>\n<li>Browse and clear stale cache entries directly in the UI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This visual experience helps reduce operational overhead and provides development teams with clearer insight into how dependencies are resolved, enabling them to make better decisions about build performance and security policies.</p>\n<p>Watch a demo:</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;video_container&quot;&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiOZJPhAvaI?si=cYaoR_OIgqFKbyM2&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>We invite enterprise customers to join the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/543045\">Maven Virtual Registry Beta program</a> and share feedback to help shape the final release.</p>\n<h2>AI that adapts to your workflow</h2>\n<p>This release represents more than new capabilities — it's about choice and control.

Support for AWS- and GCP-issued secrets is planned for future releases.\nCustom rules for Advanced SAST\nAdvanced SAST runs on rules informed by our in-house security research team, designed to maximize accuracy out of the box. However, some teams required additional flexibility to tune the SAST engine for their specific organization. With Custom Rules for Advanced SAST, AppSec teams can define atomic, pattern-based detection logic to help capture security issues specific to their organization — like flagging banned function calls — while still using GitLab’s curated ruleset as the baseline. Customizations are managed through simple TOML files, just like other SAST ruleset configurations. While these rules will not support taint analysis, they do give organizations greater flexibility in achieving accurate SAST results.\nAdvanced SAST C and C++ language support\nWe’re expanding our language coverage for Advanced SAST to include C and C++, which are widely used languages in embedded systems software development. To enable scanning, projects must generate a compilation database that captures compiler commands and includes paths used during builds. This works to ensure the scanner can accurately parse and analyze source files, delivering precise, context-aware results that help security teams identify real vulnerabilities in the development process. The implementation requirements for C and C++ require specific configurations, which can be found in our documentation. Advanced SAST C and C++ support are currently available in beta.\nDiff-based SAST scanning\nTraditional SAST scans re-analyze entire codebases with every commit, slowing pipelines and disrupting developer flow. The developer experience is a critical consideration that can make or break the adoption of application security testing. Diff-based SAST scanning aims to speed up scan times by focusing only on the code changed in a merge request, reducing redundant analysis and surfacing relevant results tied to the developer’s work. By aligning scans with actual code changes, GitLab delivers faster, more focused feedback that helps keep developers in flow while maintaining strong security coverage.\nSimplify API configurations\nAPI-driven workflows offer power and flexibility, but they can also create unnecessary complexity for tasks that teams need to perform regularly. The new Maven Virtual Registry interface brings a UI layer to these operations.\nMaven Virtual Registry interface\nThe new web-based interface for managing Maven Virtual Registries turns complex API configurations into visual simplicity, providing a more intuitive experience for package administrators and platform engineers.\nPreviously, teams configured and maintained virtual registries only through API calls, which made routine maintenance time-consuming and required specialized platform knowledge. The new interface removes that barrier, helping to make everyday tasks faster and easier.\nWith this update, you can now:\nCreate virtual registries to simplify dependency configuration\nCreate and order upstreams to help improve performance and compliance\nBrowse and clear stale cache entries directly in the UI\nThis visual experience helps reduce operational overhead and provides development teams with clearer insight into how dependencies are resolved, enabling them to make better decisions about build performance and security policies.\nWatch a demo:\n<!-- blank line -->\n<figure class=\"video_container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiOZJPhAvaI?si=cYaoR_OIgqFKbyM2\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"> </iframe>\n</figure>\n<!-- blank line -->\n<p></p>\nWe invite enterprise customers to join the Maven Virtual Registry Beta program and share feedback to help shape the final release.\nAI that adapts to your workflow\nThis release represents more than new capabilities — it's about choice and control. Watch the walkthrough video here:\n<p></p>\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1128992281?badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"18.5-tech-demo\"></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>\n<p></p>\nGitLab Premium and Ultimate users can start using these capabilities today on GitLab.com and self-managed environments, with availability for GitLab Dedicated customers planned for next month.\nGitLab Duo Agent Platform is currently in beta — enable beta and experimental features to experience how full-context AI can transform the way your teams build software. New to GitLab? Start your free trial and see why the future of development is AI-powered, secure, and orchestrated through the world’s most comprehensive DevSecOps platform.\nNote: Platform capabilities that are in beta are available as part of the GitLab Beta program. They are free to use during the beta period, and when generally available, they will be made available with a paid add-on option for GitLab Duo Agent Platform.\nStay up to date with GitLab\nTo make sure you’re getting the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements, we recommend keeping your GitLab instance up to date. The following resources can help you plan and complete your upgrade:\nUpgrade Path Tool – enter your current version and see the exact upgrade steps for your instance\nUpgrade Documentation – detailed guides for each supported version, including requirements, step-by-step instructions, and best practices\nBy upgrading regularly, you’ll ensure your team benefits from the newest GitLab capabilities and remains secure and supported.\nFor organizations that want a hands-off approach, consider GitLab’s Managed Maintenance service. With Managed Maintenance, your team stays focused on innovation while GitLab experts keep your Self-Managed instance reliably upgraded, secure, and ready to lead in DevSecOps.
