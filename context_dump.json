    "content": "We introduce MemoriesDB, a unified data architecture designed to avoid decoherence across time, meaning, and relation in long-term computational memory. Each memory is a time-semantic-relational entity-a structure that simultaneously encodes when an event occurred, what it means, and how it connects to other events. Built initially atop PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, MemoriesDB combines the properties of a time-series datastore, a vector database, and a graph system within a single append-only schema. Each memory is represented as a vertex uniquely labeled by its microsecond timestamp and accompanied by low- and high-dimensional normalized embeddings that capture semantic context. Directed edges between memories form labeled relations with per-edge metadata, enabling multiple contextual links between the same vertices. Together these constructs form a time-indexed stack of temporal-semantic surfaces, where edges project as directional arrows in a 1+1-dimensional similarity field, tracing the evolution of meaning through time while maintaining cross-temporal coherence. This formulation supports efficient time-bounded retrieval, hybrid semantic search, and lightweight structural reasoning in a single query path. A working prototype demonstrates scalable recall and contextual reinforcement using standard relational infrastructure, and we discuss extensions toward a columnar backend, distributed clustering, and emergent topic modeling."

However, existing search agent pipelines typically depend on reinforcement learning based optimization, which often suffers from sparse outcome rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and unstable training. We introduce CriticSearch, a fine-grained credit-assignment framework that supplies dense, turn-level feedback via a retrospective critic mechanism. During training, a frozen, asymmetric critique LLM retrospectively evaluates each turn using privileged information from the full trajectory and gold answers, converting these assessments into stable, dense rewards that guide policy improvement. Experimental results across diverse multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CriticSearch consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving faster convergence, improved training stability, and higher performance."

    "content": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search."

    "content": "The optimal assignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized roles in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge, defined by a vast combinatorial search space, expensive black-box evaluations, and an inherent trade-off between performance and cost. Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem. This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement. The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance. The framework thus provides a data-driven tool for deploying cost-effective and highly specialized multi-agent AI systems."

Entities that are close in graph distance will have lower surprise than those farther apart. This connects the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from neuroscience to KG systems, where the KG serves as the agent's generative model. We formalize surprise using the shortest-path distance in directed graphs and provide a framework for KG-based agents. Graph distance appears in graph neural networks as message passing depth and in model-based reinforcement learning as world model trajectories. This work-in-progress study explores whether distance-based surprise can extend recent work showing that syntax minimizes surprise and free energy via tree structures."

Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs."

Existing hallucination detectors rely on semantic similarity metrics that tolerate entity substitutions, a dangerous failure mode when confusing parties, dates, or legal provisions can have material consequences. We introduce HalluGraph, a graph-theoretic framework that quantifies hallucinations through structural alignment between knowledge graphs extracted from context, query, and response. Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \\textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \\textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($&gt;$400 words, $&gt;$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \\approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages."

You need a database that:</p> \n \n<p>✅ <strong>Stores semantic understanding</strong> (vectors) alongside structured data (filters)<br> \n✅ <strong>Handles dynamic, evolving schemas</strong> (conversations, metadata, user context)<br> \n✅ <strong>Enables bidirectional data flow</strong> (agents read, write, and transform)<br> \n✅ <strong>Performs at scale</strong> (millisecond searches across thousands of documents)<br> \n✅ <strong>Provides a unified platform</strong> (no juggling multiple databases)</p> \n \n<p>MongoDB Atlas delivers all of this with its Document Model and Vector Search capabilities. As we've seen in this rental search application:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li> \n<strong>Agents feed FROM the database</strong> using semantic vector search combined with traditional filters</li> \n<li> \n<strong>Agents feed TO the database</strong> by storing rich conversation context and metadata</li> \n<li> \n<strong>Agents transform the UI</strong> through structured metadata that synchronizes with interface elements</li> \n</ol> \n \n<p>This bidirectional architecture represents the future of AI-powered applications. And MongoDB Atlas makes it not just possible, but elegant, performant, and production-ready.</p> \n \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Try It Yourself \n</h2> \n \n<p>The complete code for this project is available on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mongodb-openai-agentic-rentals\">mongodb-openai-agentic-rentals</a></p> \n \n<p><strong>Quick Start</strong>:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/mongodb-openai-agentic-rentals.git \n \n<span>cd </span>mongodb-openai-agentic-rentals \nbun <span>install</span> \n<span># Configure .env with your MongoDB Atlas URI and OpenAI API key</span> \nnode seed-hf-airbnb-data.js \nbun start \n<span># Visit http://localhost:5000/index.html</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p><strong>What to explore</strong>:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li>Try natural language queries: \"Find me a beachfront property in Sydney\"</li> \n<li>Watch the UI filters update automatically</li> \n<li>Check the MongoDB conversation collection to see stored context</li> \n<li>Examine the aggregation pipelines in <code>src/services/vector-search.service.js</code> \n</li> \n<li>Extend the agent with new tools in <code>src/agents/rental-rag-agent.js</code> \n</li> \n</ol> \n \n \n \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Additional Resources \n</h2> \n \n<ul> \n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/\">MongoDB Atlas Vector Search Documentation</a></li> \n<li><a href=\"https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/\">OpenAI Agents SDK</a></li> \n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/\">MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline</a></li> \n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/\">Document Model Design Best Practices</a></li> \n</ul> \n \n \n \n \n<p><strong>About the Author</strong>: Pavel Duchovny is a Developer Advocate at MongoDB, passionate about helping developers build intelligent, scalable applications.

    "content": "<p>Most search engines will show you pages that <em>mention</em> the same keywords.</p> \n \n<p>But what if you want to find articles that express the <strong>same ideas</strong>, even if they’re written completely differently?</p> \n \n<p>That’s the problem that pushed me into building something new.</p> \n \n<p>A few months ago, I needed to verify whether parts of my content were being reused online. Google wasn’t helpful — keyword search missed half of the semantically similar pages. Rephrased paragraphs were completely invisible.</p> \n \n<p>So I built my own engine.</p> \n \n<p>Today, I’m excited to introduce <strong><a href=\"https://nooth.dev/\">Nooth</a></strong>, an AI-powered system that takes <em>any text you enter</em> and searches the web for content with similar themes, ideas, and semantic meaning.</p> \n \n<p>Drop in a paragraph → get URLs, similarity percentages, and deep analytical insights.</p> \n \n<p>Here’s how it works under the hood.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>🚀 The Idea</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Traditional search relies on keyword overlap.</p> \n \n<p>If two texts don’t share the same words, the engine assumes they’re unrelated.</p> \n \n<p>But humans don’t think that way.</p> \n \n<p>We recognize similarity through <strong>meaning</strong> — the structure of ideas, not characters.</p> \n \n<p>So the goal was simple:</p> \n \n<blockquote> \n<p><strong>Build an engine that understands what your text is about, then find everything on the internet that expresses the same ideas.</strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n \n<p>That meant two pieces were crucial:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li><p><strong>A way to measure meaning</strong></p></li> \n<li><p><strong>A way to scan the web, extract clean text, and compare it</strong></p></li> \n</ol> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>🧠 Step 1: Turning Text Into Meaning (Embeddings)</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>At the core of Nooth is a semantic model that converts text into embeddings — numerical vectors that represent meaning.</p> \n \n<p>Example:</p> \n \n<blockquote> \n<p>“How to speed up your Node.js API”</p> \n \n<p>and</p> \n \n<p>“Optimizing performance in a JavaScript backend”</p> \n</blockquote> \n \n<p>These look different, but in vector space, their embeddings are neighbors.</p> \n \n<p>Every time you paste text into Nooth:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li><p>it cleans and normalizes it</p></li> \n<li><p>creates sentence-level embeddings</p></li> \n<li><p>composes them into a unified “semantic fingerprint”</p></li> \n</ul> \n \n<p>That fingerprint becomes the reference point for the search.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>🌐 Step 2: Finding Content Across the Web</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Nooth crawls and indexes content using:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li><p>lightweight scrapers</p></li> \n<li><p>structured metadata</p></li> \n<li><p>boilerplate removal</p></li> \n<li><p>language detection</p></li> \n<li><p>canonical URL resolution</p></li> \n<li><p>and chunking for long-form content</p></li> \n</ul> \n \n<p>The goal isn’t to store the entire HTML — only the <strong>meaningful part</strong>:</p> \n \n<p>titles, headings, paragraphs, and contextual metadata.</p> \n \n<p>Each chunk gets its own embedding.</p> \n \n<p>That allows highly precise, paragraph-level similarity detection.</p> \n \n \n \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>📊 Step 3: Computing Semantic Similarity</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Once all candidates are scraped, Nooth performs:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li><p>cosine similarity</p></li> \n<li><p>conceptual overlap scoring</p></li> \n<li><p>syntactic variance weighting</p></li> \n<li><p>partial-match scoring (for rewritten content)</p></li> \n</ul> \n \n<p>This combination is what lets Nooth detect even heavily rephrased articles.</p> \n \n<p>It doesn’t just ask:</p> \n \n<p><strong>“Do these texts share words?”</strong></p> \n \n<p>It asks:</p> \n \n<p><strong>“Do these texts express the same thing?”</strong></p> \n \n \n \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>🔍 Step 4: Presenting Clear Evidence</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>The final result looks like this (example flow):</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li><p>You paste a paragraph</p></li> \n<li><p>Engine breaks it into meaning blocks</p></li> \n<li><p>It fetches

    "content": "<p>I, like many of us over the last year or so, have been on an interesting journey when it comes to software development. </p> \n \n<p>From using ChatGPT to show me how to use sk-learn to build a classifier in 2022, seeing tab completion reach super saiyan level with copilot in 2023 (or was it 2024?! - It all seems like ancient history) on an engineers machine at work, using Cursor to remove the friction of copy/pasting out of chatgpt in 2024, to adopting my own form of the <a href=\"https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD?tab=readme-ov-file\">BMAD method</a> to build out some really nice pet projects using a variety of tools like Claude Code, Cursor and Codex here in 2025.</p> \n \n<p>That's my personal experience compressed into a small paragraph, possibly a similar experience had by many on here have already had. The past few years have been a hell of a ride and I am finding I am now using more AI tools than ever. </p> \n \n<p>Over that time I have enjoyed reading many an article on DEV.TO on how many of us have our own approaches to get the best in this new paradigm, coupled with the 'X AI Feature/Product.. is Insane' YouTube videos (seriously guys, please stop). </p> \n \n<p>There have been some real nuggets in this that I have found, I've already mentioned the BMAD Method (which I still use to this day, albeit a bit more lightweight). Managing context window was another, and probably my favourite of all was <a href=\"https://github.com/upstash/context7\">context7</a>.  </p> \n \n<p>Using context7 also made me realise something, the models are more accurate when the information is inside their context window and they are not having to rely on training data.</p> \n \n<p>For me the training data is almost like a necessary evil, I want them to rely on it less and less, please allow me to explain a bit further. </p> \n \n<p>Let's imagine I am looking to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. If you were looking to do this a few months back, the models straight up didn't know about MCP, so you were forced to ask it to use context7 and a web search to bring back the necessary data. </p> \n \n<p>Even today, with the models with the more recent training data, things are developing so fast in MCP, what it is likely to surface could be out of date and is more than likely not the optimal implementation pattern, so using Context7 I was able to be more confident in the approaches the Agent would suggest, especially when they could cite the sources and I could go validate them myself.  </p> \n \n<p>Like any other developer, once you solve a problem, you like to keep that pattern for other projects and over time your toolbox gets bigger and better. It should be no different with AIs, in fact, if anything it is even more important to ensure that the AIs have your taste, preferences and best practices in mind whenever they are implementing on your behalf. </p> \n \n<p>Simultaneously, I was working on my own AI agents, I've been developing agents for about six months now. As a learning exercise mostly, but I found it to actually be really fun. </p> \n \n<p>The first thing that anyone engineering an agent will realise is that you need memory. Even if it is just reinjecting the conversation history back to the agent so you can have continuity between requests. </p> \n \n<p>As you work on these you start to envisage better systems for memory. You often start to architect different types of memory, short term (a simple version being what I described in the previous paragraph), long term memory - for example some kind of automated retrieval of relevant facts/conversations that had been during previous interactions. </p> \n \n<p>There's also the breakdown of episodic (temporal and spatial context - \"I had a meeting last week about the new payroll implementation\"), semantic (facts and concepts - \"payroll is a term to describe the business process of paying employees\"), procedural (motor skills, and how to knowledge - \"to put up a shelf I first..\" &lt;- I am still to learn this one).</p> \n \n<p>Ultimately the answer usually ends up with some kind of persistence layer, a search mechanism and some service to pull it all together (maybe even some sub-agent specifically to manage retrieval and storage of memories) at inference time.</p> \n \n<p>So with this in mind I went away and vibe coded up an MCP server for agentic systems to store memories in. I did it in an evening and spent the rest of the weekend dogfooding it on systems like Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex and Cursor. I had built this tool for my own agents that I was building, but I actually found it really useful in my coding agents. I quickly set about encoding the code for all my projects into memories, getting encoding agents to attach documents and code snippets to sit alongside memories so that an agent querying the knowledge base could get an idea of a particular pattern, or the way something worked, just from what was in the knowledge base and dig into the code if needed. </p> \n \n<p>In this sense, the MCP server I had built became very much like my own little mini context7, well actually a bit more than that really. I could ask it to look at the code in those repos of course, but it would still lack information about design decisions, information for how we resolved an issue, preferred patterns and when to use them. It just felt like I was working in the same session across multiple projects/agents, it was really refreshing. </p> \n \n<p>I had hosted this remotely and managed to connect it to Claude Mobile via <a href=\"https://dev.to/scott_raisbeck_24ea5fbc1e/i-spent-a-week-building-oauth-plumbing-that-shouldnt-exist-1h34\">Dynamic Client Registration</a>, </p> \n \n<p>So now when I was out having a walk or something and I had an idea around something related to one of my projects, Claude had semantic understanding of it. It meant I could have meaningful conversations about it without it having to scan through code. </p> \n \n<p>I could even make decisions with Claude while out on that walk, get it to record a memory (and an implementation plan document) and then once I was back home just tell Claude Code to go ahead and implement. The same applied to using other agentic coding applications, such as Cursor, Copilot and Codex. </p> \n \n<p>I found myself logging every design decision in the memory, and then just having built in commands to fetch context for when I started out a new session. This worked across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and Copilot. Which has been my arsenal of AI coding tools for the past few months (could I get by with just one? Yes, but those YouTube videos I mentioned earlier.. they're unfortunately really effective - so please stop guys, I have kids to feed). </p> \n \n<p>Anyhow, it didn't take long for me to realise that I needed to build a proper version of this as I was depending on it more and more in my daily work. While it all worked fine and felt pretty robust, I didn't like the way Claude had implemented it, maybe I shouldn't care but I do. In order to understand something, I need to build it and all that good stuff, I believe dr Feinman said something along those lines, I am certainly no Richard Feinman but I can still appreciate that sentiment. </p> \n \n<p>So I set about building out a new version of it, gave it a name (Forgetful) and decided I'd make it open source to see if it would be useful for others - be it for people using coding agents (which was a use case I had found myself accidently having) to AI engineers build agents themselves. </p> \n \n<p>I did all this before checking if anyone else had built one by the way, there are several out there now, some paid and some for free. I would encourage you to check them out and see what works for you. I do see this as the next paradigm in AI, cross agent memory solutions are going to be key, especially as the AI ecosystem seems to open up more and more for third party apps on some of the big AI labs systems and I cannot tell you how much this has helped my own use of coding agents. I am working on something right now for my day job that I plan on showcasing, but that is for another post (as it's not finished) and Forgetful sits at the heart of it.</p> \n \n<p>It's not some 'I 10xd my AI workflow' hack, I don't know what kind of gains this has given me, I don't really have a way to measure it. </p> \n \n<p>I just feel more comfortable switching between projects and agents now and perhaps more importantly getting the agents more familiar with the patterns you use and  reducing the need to have the same conversation with AI's to tackle the same problem elsewhere. </p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  So What Did I Actually Build? \n</h2> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5u0mcmc5s3p5og7nz9kw.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5u0mcmc5s3p5og7nz9kw.png\" alt=\"Architecture Diagram\" width=\"800\" height=\"416\"></a></p> \n \n<p>When I sat down to build Forgetful properly, I had to make some decisions about how memories should be structured. This is where I got opinionated.</p> \n \n<p>Most memory systems are essentially vector dumps — throw everything in, embed it, retrieve by cosine similarity, hope for the best. It works, but it's messy. You end up with overlapping chunks, no clear boundaries between concepts, and retrieval that's good enough but never precise, reranking helps to a degree, but I see this as something other than just a store. </p> \n \n<p>I wanted something more like how I use Obsidian. Atomic notes. One concept per note. Links between related ideas. A graph that emerges from the connections rather than being imposed from above. I had been using Obsidian to follow the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten\">Zettelkasten principle</a> — a note-taking method where each note captures exactly one idea, is self-contained enough to understand on its own, and links explicitly to related notes.</p> \n \n<p>I had stumbled across <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSh2BYJ29kY&amp;t=15s\">A video of someone implementing semantic encoding of their own Obisidan Notes</a> and then things started to come together. I did my usually back and forth with Claude when out for one of my walks, it threw up some papers around where similar concepts had already been tried: The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110\">A-Mem paper</a> on agentic memory systems found that structured, self-organising memory significantly improves retrieval precision. </p> \n \n<p>In Forgetful, every memory must have (these are configurable as environment variables):</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li>A clear title (forced brevity — 200 char limit)</li> \n<li>Content covering one concept (~300-400 words max)</li> \n<li>Context around what the agent was doing when it created the memory</li> \n<li>Keywords and tags for additional retrieval paths</li> \n</ul> \n \n<p>This might seem restrictive, but that's the point. When an agent goes to store something, it has to think about what the atomic unit of knowledge actually is. No more dumping entire conversations or documents into memory and hoping retrieval figures it out later.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Auto-Linking \n</h2> \n \n<p>Here's where it gets interesting. When you create a memory, Forgetful doesn't just store it — it finds its place in the graph. Now I would stipulate this is also configurable, I think the best practice is to have an agent dedicated to memory management, who takes in raw input and decides what memories are worth keeping, and how they should fit inside the knowledge base, and whether existing memories need updating or need to be made obsolete as a result of the new interactions. This however is not something I have built yet for my own development memory management and indeed might not be something others want to build. So as a starting point I added automated memory linking, and so far it has worked just fine. </p> \n \n<p>The process:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li>Generate an embedding for the new memory </li> \n<li>Search for semantically similar existing memories</li> \n<li>Any memories above a 0.7 similarity threshold and cross encoder ranked get automatically linked</li> \n<li>These links are bidirectional — the graph builds itself</li> \n</ol> \n \n<p>So if I store a memory about \"choosing Stripe over PayPal for payment processing\" and I already have memories about \"PCI compliance requirements\" and \"subscription billing architecture\", Forgetful will automatically connect them. No manual linking required.</p> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7jte83j54yk3pcpv4kcg.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7jte83j54yk3pcpv4kcg.png\" alt=\"Memory Auto-Linking\" width=\"593\" height=\"499\"></a></p> \n \n<p>When an agent later queries \"how should I handle payments?\", it doesn't just get the Stripe decision — it gets the linked context about compliance and billing architecture too. One-hop graph traversal is included by default, what I mean by that is, for every memory that is retrieved through search, all linked memories 1-hop away are returned as well. </p> \n \n<p>This is what I mean by \"Obsidian for AI agents\". The same way your Obsidian vault becomes more valuable as connections emerge between notes, your agent's memory becomes more useful as the knowledge graph densifies.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Why Not Neo4j? \n</h2> \n \n<p>I can already hear some of you asking: \"If you're building a knowledge graph, why not use a graph database?\"</p> \n \n<p>The honest answer is I've never worked with a Graph database, I'm only familiar with the relational database such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL etc.<br> \nSo Forgetful stores memories in PostgreSQL (or SQLite for the zero-config local experience) with pgvector for embeddings. The graph relationships are just rows in a links table. So no elegant graph theory, maybe it's something I'll consider in the future. I've architectued Forgetful in a way that I can add adapters quite easily for different types of implementation layers, hence why I can switch between Postgres and SQLite, so adding a Graph Database or even a dedicated Vector Database later down the line wouldn't involve a total re-write. </p> \n \n<p>The relational database appraoch appears to  works fine for my scale. For the access patterns agents actually use (store a memory, find related memories, traverse one hop), a relational model with proper indexing handles it without breaking a sweat. Maybe at massive scale I'd revisit this, but I'd rather ship something useful than architect for problems I don't have yet.</p> \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Making Retrieval Actually Good \n</h2> \n \n<p>Storing memories is the easy part. Retrieval is where most systems fall down.</p> \n \n<p>A naive approach: embed the query, find the top-k most similar memories by cosine distance, return them. This works but has problems. Embedding similarity is fuzzy — semantically related doesn't always mean actually relevant to what the agent needs right now.</p> \n \n<p>Forgetful uses a multi-stage approach:</p> \n \n<p><strong>Stage 1: Dense retrieval</strong><br> \nEmbed the query, pull back candidate memories using vector similarity. Cast a wide net.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Stage 2: Cross-encoder reranking</strong><br> \nHere's the trick — when an agent searches, it provides not just the query but a <code>query_context</code> explaining <em>why</em> it's searching. \"I'm implementing payment integration\" gives different results than \"I'm debugging a checkout error\" even if both search for \"payments\". The cross-encoder uses this full context to rerank candidates.</p> \n \n<p>The cross-encoder scores each candidate against the full query context, reranks them, and the top results go back to the agent.</p> \n \n<p>Is this overkill? Maybe. But retrieval precision is everything. Returning the wrong context is worse than returning nothing — it confidently misleads the agent.</p> \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Token Budget Management \n</h2> \n \n<p>Even with great retrieval, you can still overwhelm an agent's context window. Twenty highly relevant memories might be 15,000 tokens — and that's before the agent's actual task.</p> \n \n<p>Forgetful manages this with a configurable token budget (default 8K). Results are prioritised by:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li>Importance score (9-10 rated memories first)</li> \n<li>Recency (newest within each importance tier)</li> \n</ol> \n \n<p>If the budget fills up, lower-priority memories get truncated. The agent always gets the most critical context without the LLM choking on input length.</p> \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  From Single Machine to Cloud \n</h2> \n \n<p>One thing I wanted to get right: Forgetful should scale with your needs.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Just trying it out?</strong><br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>uvx forgetful-ai \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>That's it. SQLite database, stored in your home directory, stdio transport for MCP. Zero configuration.</p> \n \n<p>The default setup runs completely offline — embeddings are generated locally using FastEmbed with the BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model. No OpenAI API key required, no data leaves your machine. If you want cloud embeddings (Azure OpenAI, Google), you can configure that, but it's entirely optional.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Running it for real?</strong><br> \nDocker Compose with PostgreSQL, HTTP transport, proper authentication. Same codebase, same API, just different deployment.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Multi-device access?</strong><br> \nHost it somewhere with an endpoint, configure your MCP clients to point at it. I run mine on a VPS and connect from Claude Desktop, Claude Mobile, Cursor, and Claude Code — all hitting the same knowledge base.</p> \n \n<p>The progression should feel natural. Start local, go remote when you need to.</p> \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  What Else Is In There? \n</h2> \n \n<p>Memories are the core, but Forgetful has a few other concepts that emerged from real usage:</p> \n \n<p><strong>Entities</strong>: Concrete things — people, organisations, products, infrastructure. These can have relationships to each other (\"Jordan works_for TechFlow\") and link to memories. Useful for building out knowledge about your team, your systems, your clients.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Projects</strong>: Scope for memories. When I'm working on the e-commerce platform, I don't need memories from the trading bot project polluting my context. Project scoping keeps retrieval focused.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Documents</strong>: Sometimes you need more than 400 words. Documents store long-form content, with the expectation that you'll extract atomic memories from them that link back to the parent.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Code Artifacts</strong>: Reusable code snippets attached to memories. The agent can retrieve not just the concept but a working example.</p> \n \n<p>All of these link together. An entity can relate to memories, which belong to projects, which have associated documents and code artifacts. The graph extends beyond just memory-to-memory connections.</p> \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The Meta-Tools Pattern \n</h2> \n \n<p>One last implementation detail that I'm quite pleased with.</p> \n \n<p>MCP clients see three tools from Forgetful:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li> \n<code>discover_tools</code> — what's available?</li> \n<li> \n<code>how_to_use</code> — how does a specific tool work?</li> \n<li> \n<code>execute_tool</code> — run a tool with arguments</li> \n</ul> \n \n<p>Behind that facade sit 42 actual tools. The agent discovers what it needs, learns how to use it, then executes. This keeps the tool list in the agent's context minimal while still exposing full functionality.</p> \n \n<p>It's a small thing, but context window discipline matters. Every token spent on tool definitions is a token not available for actual reasoning. The numbers matter here: exposing dozens of tools with full JSON schemas would consume thousands of tokens before the agent even starts working. The three meta-tools keep context overhead minimal while still providing full access to everything Forgetful can do.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>That's Forgetful. An opinionated memory system built on Zettelkasten principles, with auto-linking, proper retrieval, and a deployment model that scales from \"just trying it\" to \"running in production\".</p> \n \n<p>If you want to try it:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>uvx forgetful-ai \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/ScottRBK/forgetful\">github.com/ScottRBK/forgetful</a></p> \n \n<p>Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/ngaUjKWkFJ\">If you are into building AI Agents or even just like talking about coding agents and AI in general head over to my discord</a></p> \n \n<p>I'd love to hear how you use it, what breaks, and what's missing. I'd imagine that this will be something i continually work on as part of agent development, so having the input of others will be most helpful! </p> \n \n<p>Next post: I'll show what I'm building on top of Forgetful for my day job — a system for semantic understanding of 250+ repositories. But that's for another time.</p>"

    "content": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

    "content": "Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise."

Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture, \\emph{A}utoregressive \\emph{M}ulti-\\emph{E}mbedding \\emph{R}etriever (AMER). Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\\% relative gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on. Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a new direction for future work."

    "content": "Production vector search systems often fan out each query across parallel lanes (threads, replicas, or shards) to meet latency service-level objectives (SLOs). In practice, these lanes rediscover the same candidates, so extra compute does not increase coverage. We present a coordination-free lane partitioner that turns duplication into complementary work at the same cost and deadline. For each query we (1) build a deterministic candidate pool sized to the total top-k budget, (2) apply a per-query pseudorandom permutation, and (3) assign each lane a disjoint slice of positions. Lanes then return different results by construction, with no runtime coordination. At equal cost with four lanes (total candidate budget 64), on SIFT1M (1M SIFT feature vectors) with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW) recall@10 rises from 0.249 to 0.999 while lane overlap falls from nearly 100% to 0%. On MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with HNSW, hit@10 improves from 0.200 to 0.601 and Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) from 0.133 to 0.330. For inverted file (IVF) indexes we see smaller but consistent gains (for example, +11% on MS MARCO) by de-duplicating list routing. A microbenchmark shows planner overhead of ~37 microseconds per query (mean at the main setting) with linear growth in the number of merged candidates. These results yield a simple operational guideline: size the per-query pool to the total budget, deterministically partition positions across lanes, and turn redundant fan-out into complementary coverage without changing budget or deadline."

However, their high-dimensional, high-precision (float32) vector embeddings create significant storage and memory challenges for real-world deployment. To address this, we conduct a rigorous empirical study on the BEIR SciFact benchmark, evaluating the trade-offs between two primary compression strategies: (1) Dimensionality Reduction via deep Autoencoders (AE), reducing original 384-dim vectors to latent spaces from 384 down to 12, and (2) Precision Reduction via Quantization (float16, int8, and binary). We systematically compare each method by measuring the \"performance loss\" (or gain) relative to a float32 baseline across a full suite of retrieval metrics (NDCG, MAP, MRR, Recall, Precision) at various k cutoffs. Our results show that int8 scalar quantization provides the most effective \"sweet spot,\" achieving a 4x compression with a negligible [~1-2%] drop in nDCG@10. In contrast, Autoencoders show a graceful degradation but suffer a more significant performance loss at equivalent 4x compression ratios (AE-96). binary quantization was found to be unsuitable for this task due to catastrophic performance drops. This work provides a practical guide for deploying efficient, high-performance retrieval systems."

To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation.

However, existing resources often focus on limited dimensions, such as code smells, technical debt, or refactoring activity, thereby restricting comprehensive analyses across time and quality dimensions. To address this gap, we present the Software Quality Dataset (SQuaD), a multi-dimensional, time-aware collection of software quality metrics extracted from 450 mature open-source projects across diverse ecosystems, including Apache, Mozilla, FFmpeg, and the Linux kernel. By integrating nine state-of-the-art static analysis tools, i.e., SonarQube, CodeScene, PMD, Understand, CK, JaSoMe, RefactoringMiner, RefactoringMiner++, and PyRef, our dataset unifies over 700 unique metrics at method, class, file, and project levels. Covering a total of 63,586 analyzed project releases, SQuaD also provides version control and issue-tracking histories, software vulnerability data (CVE/CWE), and process metrics proven to enhance Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. The SQuaD enables empirical research on maintainability, technical debt, software evolution, and quality assessment at unprecedented scale. We also outline emerging research directions, including automated dataset updates and cross-project quality modeling to support the continuous evolution of software analytics. The dataset is publicly available on ZENODO (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17566690)."

Since databases can store big amount of information with synthetic and organic data, serving all quantity of objects correctly is an important task to deal with. However, the decision of how to construct entity relationship model is associated with human factor. In this paper, we present flow-oriented entity-relationship tool. This is first and unique end-to-end solution that eliminates routine and resource-intensive problems of processing, creating and visualizing both of explicit and implicit dependencies for prominent SQL dialects on-the-fly. Once launched, FLOWER automatically detects built-in constraints and starting to create own correct and necessary one using dynamic sampling and robust data analysis techniques. This approach applies to improve entity-relationship model and data storytelling to better understand the foundation of data and get unseen insights from DB sources using SQL or natural language. Evaluated on state-of-the-art STATS benchmark, experiments show that FLOWER is superior to reservoir sampling by 2.4x for distribution representation and 2.6x for constraint learning with 2.15x acceleration. For data storytelling, our tool archives 1.19x for accuracy enhance with 1.86x context decrease compare to LLM. Presented tool is also support 23 languages and compatible with both of CPU and GPU. Those results show that FLOWER can manage with real-world data a way better to ensure with quality, scalability and applicability for different use-cases."

While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead."

Companies that strategically design, architect, and operate AI workloads in the cloud can reduce costs by 30–70% without sacrificing performance. Effective cloud optimization isn’t just about cutting expenses — it’s about enabling sustainable scaling, predictable operations, and better resource management across the entire AI lifecycle.</p>  \n  \n<p>In this article, we break down the causes of high AI cloud spend, the most effective cloud cost optimization strategies, and actionable approaches to achieving meaningful cloud infrastructure cost optimization while still supporting rapid AI growth.</p>  \n  \n<p>Why AI &amp; Data Workloads Become Expensive</p>  \n  \n<p>AI workloads are fundamentally different from traditional applications. They require:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>GPU-intensive compute for training and inference</li>  \n<li>High-performance storage for large datasets</li>  \n<li>Massive data movement across networks</li>  \n<li>Always-on services for real-time applications</li>  \n<li>Distributed infrastructure for scalability</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Because of these factors, poor cloud planning can lead to unnecessary overspending. The biggest cost drivers include:</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>GPU Overprovisioning</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Data teams often spin up the largest GPU instances available (e.g., A100 or H100) even when workloads don’t require that power.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Idle Compute Resources</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Training jobs, MLOps pipelines, and inference services often run 24/7 — even when not in use.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Inefficient Storage</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Storing large datasets in high-cost storage tiers or duplicating data across environments dramatically increases bills.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Lack of Autoscaling</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Without autoscaling policies, systems remain over-allocated during low-traffic periods.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Poor Observability &amp; Cost Governance</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Teams don’t have enough visibility over cost centers, resulting in runaway cloud bills.</p>  \n  \n<p>Key Cloud Cost Optimization Strategies for AI Teams</p>  \n  \n<p>To ensure sustainable scaling, organizations must adopt a combination of engineering practices, architectural choices, and ongoing operational monitoring. Below are the most effective cloud cost optimization strategies for AI-driven systems.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Choose the Right Hardware for the Job</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>AI workloads often rely heavily on GPUs — but the “biggest GPU available” is not always the optimal choice.</p>  \n  \n<p>Strategies that work:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Use smaller GPUs (e.g., T4, L4) for inference instead of A100/H100.</li>  \n<li>Utilize spot GPU instances for training jobs with checkpoints.</li>  \n<li>Consider ARM-based processors (e.g., AWS Graviton) for preprocessing and ETL tasks.</li>  \n<li>Mix GPU and CPU-based inference where latency allows.  \nBy right-sizing compute to workload requirements, companies often achieve 30–50% savings immediately.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p><strong>Implement Autoscaling and Right-Sizing Policies</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>AI systems frequently experience unpredictable traffic spikes. Autoscaling ensures that compute resources expand during peak usage and contract during low-demand periods.</p>  \n  \n<p>Best practices:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Use horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) on Kubernetes.</li>  \n<li>Set up scale-to-zero for non-essential services.</li>  \n<li>Leverage serverless options for vector search, embeddings, or scheduled jobs.</li>  \n<li>Continuously track workloads with usage-based alerts to recommend right-sizing.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>Autoscaling alone can cut 20–40% of unnecessary spend.</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p><strong>Optimize Cloud Storage for Data Pipelines</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Storing AI datasets, embeddings, check-pointed training models, and log files can quickly get out of control.</p>  \n  \n<p>Effective optimization approaches:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Move historical datasets to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., S3 Glacier, Azure Archive).</li>  \n<li>Use columnar formats like Parquet to reduce storage size.</li>  \n<li>Deduplicate datasets with data versioning tools like DVC or LakeFS.</li>  \n<li>Archive ML logs and checkpoints automatically after validations.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>A well-designed data lifecycle plan is a key pillar of cloud infrastructure cost optimization, reducing storage costs by up to 80%.</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p><strong>Use Efficient Vector Databases and Search Architectures</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Vector search systems (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus) are essential for RAG, LLM retrieval, and semantic search, but they can be cost-heavy.</p>  \n  \n<p>Tips to control costs:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Use hybrid indexing to reduce vector storage.</li>  \n<li>Offload cold embeddings to object storage.</li>  \n<li>Use sharding and partial scale-out instead of overprovisioning large clusters.</li>  \n<li>Consider open-source solutions hosted on your own Kubernetes cluster.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Choosing the right database topology can reduce costs by 30–60%.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Compress, Quantize, and Optimize Models</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Model compression dramatically reduces inference costs by allowing smaller or cheaper compute instances to serve requests.</p>  \n  \n<p>Popular optimization methods:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Quantization (FP16, INT8, INT4)</li>  \n<li>Pruning and distillation</li>  \n<li>Token-level caching for LLMs</li>  \n<li>Serving with optimized runtimes like ONNX Runtime or TensorRT</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>For many companies, model optimization means cutting inference costs in half with minimal accuracy loss.</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Spot Instances for Training</p>  \n  \n<p>Training LLMs, CV models, and deep neural networks is expensive, but spot GPU instances can slash cost if jobs are checkpointed.</p>  \n  \n<p>For example:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>AWS EC2 Spot</li>  \n<li>GCP Preemptible Instances</li>  \n<li>Azure Spot VMs</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Spot training can reduce costs by 70–90%, especially for long-running batch tasks.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Improve Observability and Cost Governance</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>Without proper monitoring, cost leaks remain invisible.</p>  \n  \n<p>Tools your team should use:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>AWS Cost Explorer / Azure Cost Management</li>  \n<li>Kubecost for Kubernetes</li>  \n<li>DataDog or Grafana for resource usage</li>  \n<li>MLflow or Weights &amp; Biases to track training costs</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>For full cloud cost optimization, every team — AI, engineering, product — must see and own their usage patterns.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Adopt a Zero-Waste Cloud Philosophy</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>These advanced methods ensure minimal waste across the infrastructure:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Delete unused snapshots, volumes, clusters, and load balancers.</li>  \n<li>Shut down dev environments at night/weekends.</li>  \n<li>Separate dev/stage/prod with strict quotas.</li>  \n<li>Automate resource cleanup with cron jobs or Lambdas.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Teams that adopt zero-waste practices save up to 20% monthly with no engineering effort.</p>  \n  \n<p>Optimization Strategies for AI Training vs. Inference</p>  \n  \n<p>AI workloads fall into two categories — training and inference — and both require different optimization tactics.</p>  \n  \n<p>Training Optimization</p>  \n  \n<p>Training is GPU-heavy, long-running, and typically done in batches.</p>  \n  \n<p>Best strategies:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Use spot GPUs</li>  \n<li>Enable gradient checkpointing</li>  \n<li>Select smaller batch sizes</li>  \n<li>Choose cheaper regions</li>  \n<li>Perform distributed training when needed</li>  \n<li>Use autoscaling clusters like SageMaker or Vertex AI</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Inference Optimization</p>  \n  \n<p>Inference must be fast, scalable, and cost-efficient.</p>  \n  \n<p>Best strategies:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Use small or quantized models</li>  \n<li>Deploy on smaller GPUs (T4/L4 or CPU for light tasks)</li>  \n<li>Use token streaming and caching</li>  \n<li>Autoscale aggressively</li>  \n<li>Use serverless inference (AWS Lambda + EFS, Vertex AI Serverless)</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Building a Cloud Cost Optimization Culture</p>  \n  \n<p>Technology alone can’t solve the cost challenge — teams must adopt the right mindset.</p>  \n  \n<p>This includes:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Engineering estimating cloud impact before development</li>  \n<li>Architecture teams reviewing infra decisions</li>  \n<li>Product managers understanding budget implications</li>  \n<li>Finance collaborating with tech leaders</li>  \n<li>Automated alerts when cost thresholds are reached</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Companies that follow this culture see long-term success with cloud infrastructure cost optimization.</p>  \n  \n<p>Scale AI Smartly, Not Expensively</p>  \n  \n<p>AI-driven systems and data-intensive workloads are inherently resource-hungry, but they don’t have to be financially unsustainable. By combining engineering best practices, architectural decisions, automation, and operational discipline, organizations can dramatically reduce cloud spend without compromising performance.</p>  \n  \n<p>The key to effective cloud cost optimization is simple:<br>  \nPay only for what brings value — eliminate everything else.</p>  \n  \n<p>With the right set of cloud cost optimization strategies, you can scale LLMs, vector databases, analytics pipelines, and real-time AI systems efficiently, confidently, and cost-effectively.</p>"

Agents consist of a client that interacts with the user and a server that performs the required tasks. The interaction between the client, server, and LLM occurs via the Model Context Protocol <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro\">MCP</a>.</p> \n \n<p>MCP servers often have access to sensitive information, such as an internal source code repository or a customer database. Of course, not all users should have access to this data, even through an agent. To protect against unauthorized access, the Model Context Protocol specification describes the possibility of authorization based on OAuth 2.1: <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization\">https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization</a>.</p> \n \n<p>In this article, we will deploy a simple MCP server developed based on <a href=\"https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai\">Spring AI</a> and close it with the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenIG\">OpenIG</a> authorization gateway.

OpenAM acts as a reliable authentication and authorization center, issuing and validating tokens, while OpenIG filters requests, blocking unauthorized access and proxying traffic to protected resources. This approach minimizes the risk of sensitive data leaks - from internal repositories to customer databases.</p> \n \n<p>Download the source code from GitHub, test the configuration, and integrate it into your projects.

    "content": "Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research."

    "content": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers."

The following high-level architecture shows the simple flow of how a request is processed from start to finish. When a user asks a question, the Amazon Q Agent interprets the request and determines whether it needs to retrieve information or perform an action. If the request is informational, the agent searches the connected Knowledge Base, retrieves the most relevant documents, and generates a clear response for the user. If the request requires an operation such as creating a resource or retrieving system data the agent triggers a Lambda function or OpenAPI action to execute the task on AWS services. Once the action is completed, the result is returned to the agent, which then converts it into a user-friendly answer.<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code>┌────────────────────────┐  \n│      User Question     │  \n└─────────────┬──────────┘  \n              │  \n              ▼  \n┌────────────────────────┐  \n│      Amazon Q Agent    │  \n└─────────────┬──────────┘  \n              │  \n              ▼  \n┌────────────────────────┐  \n│      Processing Logic  │  \n└─────────────┬──────────┘  \n              │  \n              ▼  \n┌────────────────────────┐        ┌────────────────────────┐  \n│     Document Search    │ ◄ ──── │     Knowledge Base     │  \n└─────────────┬──────────┘        └────────────────────────┘  \n              │  \n              ▼  \n┌────────────────────────┐  \n│    Response Generation │  \n└─────────────┬──────────┘  \n              │  \n       ┌──────┴─────────────────────────────┐  \n       ▼                                    ▼  \n┌────────────────────────┐    ┌────────────────────────┐  \n│       User Answer      │    │    Action Execution    │  \n└────────────────────────┘    └─────────────┬──────────┘  \n                                            │  \n                                            ▼  \n                               ┌────────────────────────┐  \n                               │      AWS Services      │  \n                               └────────────────────────┘  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<p>This simple flow helps illustrate how the agent intelligently switches between knowledge retrieval and operational execution, allowing it to both answer questions and perform real-world tasks seamlessly.</p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>Pricing Breakdown</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p><em>Important:</em> All these prices were collected using the AWS Pricing Calculator MCP Server integrated with Amazon Q Pro.

You prompt, the AI generates code, something isn't quite right, you prompt again, the AI breaks something else while fixing the first issue, you prompt again. An hour later you're deeper in the hole than when you started, caught in what's now called <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/4056586/doomprompting-endless-tinkering-with-ai-outputs-can-cripple-it-results.html\">doomprompting</a>: you keep going because you've already invested so much time.  </p>  \n  \n<p>This is the dark side of <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383\">vibe coding</a>, Andrej Karpathy's term for fully surrendering to AI-generated code without really understanding it. Karpathy himself noted it's \"not too bad for throwaway weekend projects.\" For anything more substantial, the approach tends to collapse.  </p>  \n  \n<p>I've been using <a href=\"https://github.com/github/spec-kit\">spec-kit</a>, GitHub's toolkit for spec-driven development, and it's changed how I think about AI-assisted coding. The core insight is simple: catching problems in specifications costs far less than catching them in code.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The shift-left principle applied to AI coding  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Shift-left testing is the idea that catching defects earlier in development is cheaper than catching them later. Everyone who's debugged a production issue knows this intuitively: finding a problem in requirements costs almost nothing, finding it in code review costs some rework, finding it in production costs a lot more.  </p>  \n  \n<p>Spec-kit applies this principle to AI-assisted development, but shifts even further left. Instead of catching issues through testing code, you catch them through reviewing specifications. The four-phase workflow makes this explicit: Specify, Plan, Tasks, then Implement. Each phase has a gate where you review before proceeding.  </p>  \n  \n<p>This feels familiar to anyone who studied software engineering formally. I remember university projects where we spent weeks on specifications and architecture before writing a line of code. The discipline felt excessive at the time, but the coding phase was remarkably smooth when we finally got there. Spec-kit brings that same rigor to AI-assisted development.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>What spec-kit actually provides</strong>  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>The toolkit is agent-agnostic and works with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other AI coding tools. At its core, it's a set of slash commands that guide you through structured phases:  </p>  \n  \n<p>The <code>/specify</code> command forces you to articulate what you're building. The <code>/plan</code> command generates research and technical direction. The <code>/tasks</code> command breaks the plan into discrete implementation steps. Finally, <code>/implement</code> executes those tasks.  </p>  \n  \n<p>Each phase produces markdown files that serve as both documentation and AI context. The specifications, plans, and task lists persist across sessions, acting as memory that keeps the AI aligned with your intent.  </p>  \n  \n<p>Spec-kit also introduces what it calls a \"constitution\" (I prefer \"principles,\" but the concept matters more than the name). This file establishes cross-cutting rules for your project: testing approach, coding standards, architectural constraints. These non-functional requirements apply to everything the AI generates.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  How the flow changes day-to-day work  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>My workflow with spec-kit looks different from the typical AI coding loop. I spend time reviewing and editing the specifications and task list, then let the AI implement the full feature. I treat the AI less like a pair programmer and more like a developer I'm delegating work to. I review the resulting code the way I'd review a pull request from a human team member.  </p>  \n  \n<p>This mental model matters. With pair programming, you're watching every keystroke. With delegation, you're reviewing outcomes against specifications. The latter scales better with AI tools that can implement substantial features autonomously.  </p>  \n  \n<p>The plan phase has become the most valuable. The AI performs research on the technical direction, and I've learned things from this process. More importantly, I catch misunderstandings early. During one project, the plan revealed the AI assumed an IBM Cloud serverless service was deployed on a VPC, which is incorrect. Catching that during plan review was far cheaper than discovering it through broken infrastructure code.  </p>  \n  \n<p>I don't review every single code change anymore. Instead, I review the specifications carefully, let implementation run with auto-accept enabled, do smoke testing, then review the full changeset. If issues emerge, I iterate through the full flow (plan to tasks to implementation) rather than jumping straight to code fixes. This keeps the specifications accurate and aligned with what actually got built.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The overhead question  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Spec-kit adds overhead. For simple tasks, that overhead isn't worth it.  </p>  \n  \n<p>But for larger features, I've found the investment pays back. The specifications force me to think through requirements properly. Architectural problems surface during plan review rather than after I've invested in code. And I avoid the doom-prompting loop because ambiguities in my thinking get resolved during specification, not through trial-and-error prompting.  </p>  \n  \n<p>This parallels traditional development. Some developers code first and spend months fixing bugs and refactoring. Others invest in architecture and specifications upfront. Both approaches can work, but they have different risk profiles. For complex work, the methodical approach tends to win. The same applies to AI-assisted development.  </p>  \n  \n<p>The token usage goes up when using spec-kit. You're generating specifications, plans, and task lists before writing code. But these tokens typically pay for themselves by avoiding the doom-prompting loop where you might burn through tokens endlessly without making progress.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Prompt-based flows versus coded pipelines  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>One aspect of spec-kit's design surprised me. My initial instinct would have been to implement most of the workflow in a traditional programming language with explicit control flow. Instead, spec-kit encapsulates the flow in detailed prompts with minimal supporting scripts.  </p>  \n  \n<p>This approach works well with frontier models. The prompts describe phases in natural language, and the AI follows them reliably. The templating approach with gates provides deterministic outcomes without requiring coded orchestration nodes like you'd find in LangGraph.  </p>  \n  \n<p>I suspect this approach would be less reliable with non-frontier models. The ability to follow complex, multi-phase instructions consistently requires the kind of instruction-following that frontier models do well.  </p>  \n  \n<p>Beyond the underlying model, I've noticed the tools available in each AI assistant matter. The plan phase benefits from web search, codebase search, and other research capabilities. Claude Code includes these out of the box, including deep search for thorough research. Other AI assistants may lack some of these capabilities, and I've seen the most variance in plan quality when research tools are limited.  </p>  \n  \n<p>Configuring <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\">MCP</a> tools before running through the flow also improves results. For instance, I configure tools for Terraform module registry search and cloud provider documentation lookup. These help the AI generate better-informed plans.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Adapting for infrastructure as code  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>When I started using spec-kit, I thought it would apply directly to infrastructure as code. As I progressed, I realized IaC has specific characteristics that need different handling: the declarative nature of tools like Terraform, the need to separate cloud-agnostic requirements from provider-specific implementations, governance concerns around security and cost that differ from application code, and validation against actual cloud provider APIs and module registries.  </p>  \n  \n<p>I ended up creating <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/iac-spec-kit\">iac-spec-kit</a> and open-sourced it to get more collaboration on the approach. It started as a fork, but ended up as a complete reimplementation of the commands, instructions, and templates. The only common layer is around the installer and the overall approach. The templates and prompts needed to be tuned specifically for infrastructure concerns.  </p>  \n  \n<p>The goal is to fill a gap where users can start with a high-level requirement like \"deploy WordPress\" or \"set up a three-tier web app\" and have the AI guide them through specification, planning, and code generation with review gates at each phase. The toolkit is cloud-agnostic and works with AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud, and others. Early tests look promising. I documented one end-to-end example at <a href=\"https://github.com/vburckhardt/wordpress-ibm-cloud\">vburckhardt/wordpress-ibm-cloud</a>, which shows the full workflow from initial requirements through generated Terraform code.  </p>  \n  \n<p>A specific focus has been getting AI to compose higher-level Terraform modules rather than using lower-level providers directly. AI-generated code that glues together curated, supported modules is more maintainable and supportable than code that reinvents infrastructure patterns using primitives. It's similar to teaching AI to use a well-designed library instead of writing everything from scratch.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  What this enables  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Spec-kit enables going beyond vibe coding. The structured flow feels right because it aligns with how sound engineering should work. You're not just prompting and hoping. You're defining intent, reviewing plans, and delegating implementation.  </p>  \n  \n<p>The specifications also work well for collaboration. They're markdown files that can be checked into source control and versioned. I can see workflows where teams have validation gates on specifications and plans before implementation begins. The artifacts serve as shared understanding, not just AI context.  </p>  \n  \n<p>For resuming sessions, the specification and task files act as memory. Instead of re-explaining context to the AI, the toolkit instructs it to load the existing artifacts. This makes long-running projects more manageable.  </p>  \n  \n<p>The structured flow also enables working on multiple features in parallel. While the AI implements one feature autonomously, I can work on specifications for the next one. This pattern is emerging more broadly with tools like <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/\">OpenAI Codex</a> that explicitly support parallel task execution. I expect this to become more common. The implications cut both ways: it lets independent developers and small startups move faster with limited headcount, but it also raises questions about expectations placed on developers in corporate settings.  </p>  \n  \n<p>The flow does require discipline. It's tempting to skip straight to implementation when you think you know what you want. But ambiguity in your thinking becomes apparent when you try to write it down as a specification. That's the point. The specification phase forces clarity before you've invested in code.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>When it's worth it</strong>  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Spec-kit won't eliminate all the friction from AI-assisted development. The overhead is real, and it's not worth it for every task. But for substantial features where you'd otherwise end up in a doom-prompting loop, the structured approach catches problems when they're cheap to fix.  </p>  \n  \n<p>The shift-left principle applies: review specifications, not just code. Treat AI implementation as delegation, not pair programming. Invest in the plan phase when research can improve technical direction.  </p>  \n  \n<p>If you're frustrated with vibe coding results on anything beyond weekend projects, spec-driven development is worth trying. The discipline feels familiar to anyone who's done rigorous software engineering, and the payoff is similar: smoother implementation because the thinking happened upfront.</p>"

Here's the New System. \n</h1> \n \n<h2>The Paradox: You're Climbing a Ladder That's Already Obsolete</h2> \n \n<p>You’ve seen the charts. The endless tree of technologies you’re supposed to learn to call yourself “full-stack.” HTML, CSS, JavaScript, then React, then Node.js, then SQL, then NoSQL, then Docker, then Kubernetes… it never ends. But here’s the brutal truth: <b>you’re preparing for a world that no longer exists.</b> While you’re memorizing syntax, AI is building entire applications from a single prompt.</p> \n \n<p>The game has changed. The value is no longer in being a human code compiler. The value has shifted from writing the lines to architecting the system. Your old roadmap is a trap, designed to make you a commodity in a world that now values unique insight above all.</p> \n \n<h2>The Analysis: From Code Writer to System Director</h2> \n \n<p>The fundamental shift is this: we are moving from an era of *information retrieval* to an era of *intelligence augmentation*. Previously, a developer's worth was tied to their ability to recall specific library functions or boilerplate patterns. Stuck? You’d search Stack Overflow. Now, you ask an AI co-pilot, and it generates the code instantly.</p> \n \n<blockquote>The best developers are no longer code writers; they are system architects who speak human, machine, and now, AI.</blockquote> \n \n<p>This terrifies those who built their identity on being a syntax wizard. But it should liberate you. It frees up your cognitive bandwidth to focus on what truly matters: the architecture, the user experience, the business logic, and the security of the system as a whole. Chasing the hot new JavaScript framework is a losing battle. The frameworks will come and go, churned out faster than ever with AI assistance. Your ability to think, however, is timeless.</p> \n \n<h3>The New Skill Stack: Principles Over Patterns</h3> \n \n<ul> \n  <li> \n<b>Deep Fundamentals:</b> AI can write a React component, but it can’t explain the fundamental trade-offs between server-side rendering and client-side rendering for your specific use case. You must.</li> \n  <li> \n<b>System Design:</b> How do services communicate? How does data flow? How do you ensure scalability and resilience? This is the blueprint. AI is the construction crew.</li> \n  <li> \n<b>AI Literacy:</b> You don't need to build foundational models, but you must know how to wield them. This means mastering prompt engineering, understanding API integrations, and knowing the limitations of the tools.</li> \n</ul> \n \n<h2>The System: The AI-Proof Developer Roadmap</h2> \n \n<p>Stop collecting technologies. Start building a system for thinking. This is the new path forward.</p> \n \n<p><b>1. Master the First Principles:</b> Don't just learn Express.js; master the HTTP protocol. Don't just learn PostgreSQL; master relational database theory. Principles are durable. Frameworks are fleeting.</p> \n \n<p><b>2. Think Like an Architect, Act Like a Director:</b> Spend 80% of your time on whiteboarding flows, defining data models, and planning the user journey. Use AI to generate the boilerplate and initial code. Your role is to be the editor, the curator, the director who says “no, that’s not quite right, try it this way.”</p> \n \n<blockquote>Stop chasing frameworks. Start mastering principles. AI can write boilerplate; it can't replicate deep understanding.</blockquote> \n \n<p><b>3. Build Your Leverage Stack:</b> Your stack is no longer just MERN or LAMP. It’s your brain, layered with your communication skills, your design sense, and your ability to leverage AI tools. This is your unique, uncopyable advantage. Forget the roadmap that everyone else is following. The real path is building a skill set so unique and principled that you can’t be easily replaced—by a human or a machine.</p> \n \n \n \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  🚀 Upgrade Your Mindset \n</h3> \n \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://t.me/ThinkAddictGlobal\">👉 JOIN THE SYSTEM</a></strong></p> \n \n<p><em>Visual by Think Addict System.</em></p>"

    "content": "<p>Model Context Protocol (MCP), has officially hit one year old as of November 25th and although there have been some amazing innovations within MCP, one issue still persists - the gaping security hole. This is no secret as just about every organization is talking about it. The long-running joke so far has been “The S in MCP stands for security”.</p> \n \n<p>Aside from prompt injections, MCP Server security is arguably the biggest issue in the AI security world right now.</p> \n \n<p>In this blog post, you’ll learn how to fix the gaps.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Prerequisites \n</h2> \n \n<p>To follow along with this blog post, you should have:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li>A Kubernetes cluster running (it can be local).</li> \n<li>Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs installed, which you can find <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/\">here</a>.</li> \n</ol> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Why Security Matters For MCP \n</h2> \n \n<p>There are two forms of MCP servers:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li><code>stdio</code></li> \n<li><code>StreamableHTTP</code></li> \n</ol> \n \n<p><code>stdio</code> (the communication method) stands for standard input/output. When using standard input/output, you’re typically targeting a pre-built MCP Server that’s written in, typically, Python or JS (Go is up and coming in this space) that’s called to locally via a command like <code>uvx</code> or <code>npx</code> (depending on how the MCP Server is built). It’s not a standard library download (like a <code>pip install</code>), but instead stored in cache (e.g - <code>~/.local/share/uv</code>).</p> \n \n<p><code>StreamableHTTP</code> is an external (or even internal) server that you’re reaching out to that’s not cached locally. A good example of this is the GitHub Copilot MCP Server. It’s an MCP Server that you’re reaching out to over the HTTP protocol instead of via a local cache.</p> \n \n<p>💡 There was another option called SSE which you may see, but it is now deprecated as of June 2025.</p> \n \n<p>Regardless of which option you choose, there are many security holes.</p> \n \n<p>One (of the many) problem with <code>stdio</code> MCP Servers is that you can't run them through a Gateway. That means no AuthN/Z, no rate limiting, and no tool control. The MCP Servers are effectively open and usable by anyone in an organization unless you’re manually locking each computer down with Claude Desktop configurations (which, spoiler alert: no ones doing).</p> \n \n<p>With Streamable HTTP, you’re in the dark. You’re connecting Agents to some black box running in someones datacenter with who knows what (if any) security protocols, and even if there are security protocols, that doesn’t help from an overall AuthN/Z perspective for your organization. There’s also no way to even test the security without a proper pentest, which wouldn’t be legal without explicit permission from the organization hosting the MCP Server. The only way to do it would be to put an Agent in front of the MCP Server, but then you're not actually securing the MCP Server, you're securing the Agent.</p> \n \n<p>As Model Context Protocol stands right now, there’s only one true way to secure it - with a proper AI Gateway.</p> \n \n<p>Solo Enterprise For Agentgateway implements everything from locking down tools to proper user and system-level authentication to MCP Servers with or without Agents. In the following sections, you’ll see how to configure security for MCP.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Deploy An MCP Server and Agentgateway \n</h2> \n \n<p>The first step is to deploy an MCP Server and a Gateway via agentgateway enterprise so we not only have an MCP Server to test with, but a proper AI gateway to secure our MCP connectivity.</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li>Create a new Kubernetes Deployment pointing to the test MCP Server that is containerized. You’ll also see a Service that gets deployed so the Gateway can properly connect to it. \n</li> \n</ol> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span>kubectl</span> <span>apply</span> <span>-</span><span>f</span> <span>-</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>EOF</span> \n<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>apps</span><span>/</span><span>v1</span> \n<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Deployment</span> \n<span>metadata</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>mcp-website-fetcher</span> \n  <span>namespace</span><span>:</span> <span>default</span> \n<span>spec</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>selector</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>matchLabels</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>app</span><span>:</span> <span>mcp-website-fetcher</span> \n  <span>template</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>metadata</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>labels</span><span>:</span> \n        <span>app</span><span>:</span> <span>mcp-website-fetcher</span> \n    <span>spec</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>containers</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>mcp-website-fetcher</span> \n        <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>ghcr</span><span>.</span><span>io</span><span>/</span><span>peterj</span><span>/</span><span>mcp-website-fetcher</span><span>:</span><span>main</span> \n        <span>imagePullPolicy</span><span>:</span> <span>Always</span> \n<span>---</span> \n<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>v1</span> \n<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Service</span> \n<span>metadata</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>mcp-website-fetcher</span> \n  <span>namespace</span><span>:</span> <span>default</span> \n<span>spec</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>selector</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>app</span><span>:</span> <span>mcp-website-fetcher</span> \n  <span>ports</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>-</span> <span>port</span><span>:</span> <span>80</span> \n    <span>targetPort</span><span>:</span> <span>8000</span> \n    <span>appProtocol</span><span>:</span> <span>kgateway</span><span>.</span><span>dev</span><span>/</span><span>mcp</span> \n<span>EOF</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<ol> \n<li>Deploy the Backend so agentgateway knows what to route to.

This allows you to ensure that the traffic you’re observing from an AuthN/Z perspective is valid in comparison to the “anyone can do whatever they want” nature of MCP Servers without agentgateway in place.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Locking Down MCP Tool Lists \n</h2> \n \n<p>The final step is to specify what MCP Tools are available. One of the main issues for organizations is they want to use Tools within an MCP Server, but not all Tools. For example, maybe a person or an AI Agent connecting to an MCP Server only needs the ability to view/list/get resources (like a readonly Agent), but with the current architecture out of the box available for MCP, that’s not doable.</p> \n \n<p>However, with traffic policies via agentgateway, it is.</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li>Create a policy that specifies no tools available for use.

That should be the goal for every organization and with these implementations, your MCP security posture should be in a much better place.</p>"

But let’s be honest: while EKS managed the Control Plane beautifully, the <strong>Data Plane</strong> (the worker nodes) remained a significant operational burden.</p>  \n  \n<p>As Platform Engineers and SREs, we’ve spent countless hours tuning Managed Node Groups (MNGs), debugging CNI plugin versions, wrestling with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), and fine-tuning Karpenter to get our bin-packing logic just right.</p>  \n  \n<p>With the release of <strong>EKS Auto Mode</strong>, AWS has fundamentally shifted the Shared Responsibility Model.</p>  \n  \n<p>This isn't just a minor feature update; it is a fork in the road for how we architect clusters. This guide will dissect the architectural differences between EKS Standard and Auto Mode, analyze the \"under-the-hood\" mechanics, and help you decide which path to take.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The \"Standard\" Way: Maximum Control, Maximum Toil  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>In what we now call <strong>EKS Standard</strong>, the division of labor is clear but uneven. AWS ensures the API server is up, but the moment a packet leaves the control plane, it’s your problem.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  The Standard Architecture  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>In a standard cluster, you are the architect of the infrastructure layer:</p>  \n  \n<ol>  \n<li> <strong>Compute:</strong> You define Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) or Managed Node Groups. You select the instance families (<code>m5.large</code>, <code>c6g.xlarge</code>). You decide on Spot vs. On-Demand ratios.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Scaling:</strong> You install the Cluster Autoscaler or, more likely, <strong>Karpenter</strong>. You manage the provisioner CRDs to ensure nodes spin up when pods go pending.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Operations:</strong> You are responsible for the \"Add-on Lifecycle.\" When you upgrade Kubernetes from 1.29 to 1.30, you must manually ensure the VPC CNI, CoreDNS, and Kube-proxy are compatible.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Storage &amp; Networking:</strong> You manually install the EBS CSI driver and the AWS Load Balancer Controller (LBC) via Helm.</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<p><strong>The Pain Point:</strong> The \"Undifferentiated Heavy Lifting.\"<br>  \nEvery hour you spend fixing a conflict between the VPC CNI and a new node kernel is an hour you aren't spending on application reliability. Standard mode is powerful, but it requires a dedicated Platform Team to maintain the plumbing.</p>  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Enter EKS Auto Mode: The \"Serverless\" Node Experience  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>EKS Auto Mode is AWS’s answer to the operational overhead of Kubernetes. It is distinct from Fargate (which had severe limitations regarding DaemonSets and caching) because it still runs on EC2 instances—<strong>you just don't manage them.</strong></p>  \n  \n<p>When you enable Auto Mode, EKS takes ownership of the <strong>Compute, Storage, and Networking</strong> lifecycle within the cluster.</p>  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  1. Compute: The \"Invisible\" Karpenter  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>In Auto Mode, the concept of a \"Node Group\" essentially vanishes. You don't create ASGs. You don't pick instance types.</p>  \n  \n<p>Instead, EKS uses <strong>Automated Node Pools</strong>.</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>How it works:</strong> EKS analyzes pending pods. If a pod requests 4 vCPUs and 16GB RAM, EKS automatically provisions an EC2 instance that fits that workload and joins it to the cluster.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Under the hood:</strong> It behaves remarkably like Karpenter is built directly into the Control Plane. It handles bin-packing, consolidation, and spot instance interruption handling automatically.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Maintenance:</strong> AWS handles the OS patching. When a node needs a security update, EKS seamlessly drains the node and replaces it, adhering to your Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs).</li>  \n</ul>  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  2. Networking: Native Load Balancing  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>In Standard mode, exposing a service via an Application Load Balancer (ALB) meant installing the AWS Load Balancer Controller, setting up IAM roles, and managing CRDs.</p>  \n  \n<p>In Auto Mode, this is native.</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>The Change:</strong> When you create a Service of <code>type: LoadBalancer</code>, EKS talks directly to the AWS networking APIs to provision a Network Load Balancer (NLB).</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Ingress:</strong> Similarly, creating an Ingress resource automatically triggers ALB creation without requiring a third-party controller running in your cluster.</li>  \n</ul>  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  3. Storage: Built-in CSI  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Stateful workloads in Standard mode often break during upgrades because the EBS CSI driver version falls behind the cluster version. In Auto Mode, the <strong>EBS CSI functionality is embedded</strong>. You simply request a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), and the storage appears.</p>  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Security: The Paradigm Shift  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>This is perhaps the most controversial change for old-school Ops teams: <strong>EKS Auto Mode locks down the nodes.</strong></p>  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  No SSH, No SSM  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>In Auto Mode, you cannot SSH into the worker nodes. You cannot use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Session Manager to jump into a node and run <code>htop</code>.</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>Why?</strong> The nodes are treated as ephemeral resources managed by AWS.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>The Benefit:</strong> This enforces an immutable infrastructure pattern. If a node is \"acting weird,\" you don't fix it; you delete the pod, and EKS replaces the node.</li>  \n</ul>  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  EKS Pod Identity  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Auto Mode moves away from the complex IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) OIDC setup. It defaults to <strong>EKS Pod Identity</strong>.<br>  \nThis creates a local agent on the nodes that intercepts AWS API calls from your pods and exchanges a token for temporary AWS credentials. It is significantly easier to set up in Terraform/CloudFormation than the OIDC provider method.</p>  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Comparison Matrix: Standard vs. Auto  \n</h2>  \n  \n<div><table>  \n<thead>  \n<tr>  \n<th>Feature</th>  \n<th>EKS Standard</th>  \n<th>EKS Auto Mode</th>  \n</tr>  \n</thead>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>Node Management</strong></td>  \n<td>  \n<strong>Manual</strong> (Node Groups / Karpenter)</td>  \n<td>  \n<strong>Automatic</strong> (Managed Node Pools)</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>OS Patching</strong></td>  \n<td>You trigger rollouts / AMI updates</td>  \n<td>Fully Automated by AWS</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>Instance Selection</strong></td>  \n<td>You define classes (e.g., <code>t3</code>, <code>m5</code>)</td>  \n<td>EKS selects based on Pod Spec</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>Load Balancing</strong></td>  \n<td>Install AWS LBC Helm Chart</td>  \n<td>Native / Built-in</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>EBS Storage</strong></td>  \n<td>Install EBS CSI Driver</td>  \n<td>Native / Built-in</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>Node Access</strong></td>  \n<td>SSH / SSM enabled</td>  \n<td><strong>Strictly Prohibited</strong></td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>Custom User Data</strong></td>  \n<td>Allowed (Custom Scripts)</td>  \n<td>Not Supported</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>Cost</strong></td>  \n<td>EC2 + Control Plane ($0.10/hr)</td>  \n<td>EC2 + Control Plane + Flat fee</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td><strong>Supported OS</strong></td>  \n<td>AL2, AL2023, Bottlerocket, Windows, Ubuntu</td>  \n<td>EKS Auto-optimized OS (AL2023 based)</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table></div>  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Infrastructure as Code: The Difference  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>The reduction in Terraform code required for Auto Mode is staggering.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>The \"Standard\" Way (Simplified):</strong><br>  \nYou need to define the cluster, the node groups, the IAM roles for nodes, and the Helm releases for necessary controllers.<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>module</span> <span>\"eks\"</span> <span>{</span>  \n  <span>source</span>  <span>=</span> <span>\"terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws\"</span>  \n  \n  <span># You define the hardware</span>  \n  <span>eks_managed_node_groups</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>  \n    <span>app_nodes</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>  \n      <span>instance_types</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>\"m5.large\"</span><span>]</span>  \n      <span>min_size</span>     <span>=</span> <span>2</span>  \n      <span>max_size</span>     <span>=</span> <span>10</span>  \n    <span>}</span>  \n  <span>}</span>  \n<span>}</span>  \n  \n<span># Then you must maintain this separately</span>  \n<span>resource</span> <span>\"helm_release\"</span> <span>\"aws_load_balancer_controller\"</span> <span>{</span>  \n  <span>name</span>       <span>=</span> <span>\"aws-load-balancer-controller\"</span>  \n  <span>repository</span> <span>=</span> <span>\"https://aws.github.io/eks-charts\"</span>  \n  <span>chart</span>      <span>=</span> <span>\"aws-load-balancer-controller\"</span>  \n  <span># ... extensive configuration ...</span>  \n<span>}</span>  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<p><strong>The \"Auto\" Way:</strong><br>  \nYou simply enable the capability flags.<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>resource</span> <span>\"aws_eks_cluster\"</span> <span>\"auto\"</span> <span>{</span>  \n  <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>\"production-auto\"</span>  \n  \n  <span># The \"Easy Button\"</span>  \n  <span>compute_config</span> <span>{</span>  \n    <span>enabled</span>       <span>=</span> <span>true</span>   \n    <span>node_pools</span>    <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>\"general-purpose\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"system\"</span><span>]</span>   \n    <span>node_role_arn</span> <span>=</span> <span>aws_iam_role</span><span>.</span><span>auto_node_role</span><span>.</span><span>arn</span>  \n  <span>}</span>  \n  \n  <span># Native Networking</span>  \n  <span>kubernetes_network_config</span> <span>{</span>  \n    <span>elastic_load_balancing</span> <span>{</span>  \n      <span>enabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>   \n    <span>}</span>  \n  <span>}</span>  \n  \n  <span># Native Storage</span>  \n  <span>storage_config</span> <span>{</span>  \n    <span>block_storage</span> <span>{</span>  \n      <span>enabled</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>   \n    <span>}</span>  \n  <span>}</span>  \n<span>}</span>  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<p><em>No Node Groups to define.

Risk agents manually review thousands of merchant websites every month, checking for red flags: sketchy privacy policies, misaligned pricing, questionable social media presence, suspicious domain registration patterns. </p> \n \n<p>At Razorpay, our risk operations team was conducting 10,000 to 12,000 manual website reviews monthly, each taking roughly four minutes of human attention. That's 700 to 800 human hours consumed every month, and the quality was inconsistent because different agents would interpret the same signals differently.</p> \n \n<p>The traditional approach to fraud detection involves throwing bodies at the problem or building rigid rule engines that break the moment fraudsters adapt their tactics. We needed something better, something that could scale with our transaction volume while actually getting smarter over time. </p> \n \n<p>That's why we built what we're calling <strong>Agentic Risk</strong>, a multi-agent AI system that automates merchant website evaluation from end to end while maintaining the nuanced judgment that used to require human expertise.</p> \n \n<p>Here's what makes this interesting: we didn't just replace humans with AI and call it done. We went through three distinct architectural iterations, each one teaching us hard lessons about what works and what doesn't when you're building AI agents for production fraud detection. </p> \n \n<p>The journey from our initial n8n prototype through an AI agent to our current multi-agent architecture reveals fundamental truths about building reliable AI systems at scale.</p> \n \n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" width=\"710\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://www.inoreader.com/yt-embed/?v=819bPUF0of8\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" style=\"width:100%;aspect-ratio:16/9;height:auto;display:block;border:0;\"> \n</iframe> \n</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>The Business Problem: When Manual Review Can't Keep Up</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Let me paint the picture of what risk operations looked like before automation. When a new merchant signs up for Razorpay or when our fraud detection system flags an existing merchant, a case lands in our Risk Case Manager system. A human agent picks up that case and begins the investigation dance. </p> \n \n<p>This process takes four minutes when everything goes smoothly, but that's rarely the case. Websites are structured differently, policy pages are hidden in weird places, domain information services have different interfaces, and social media handles aren't always obvious. The worst part isn't the time; it's the inconsistency. One agent might flag a merchant for having a generic privacy policy while another agent considers the same policy acceptable. </p> \n \n<p>We were also paying thousands of dollars monthly for a third-party explicit content screening service, and it was generating about 50 alerts per month with less than 10% precision. Moreover, this service only caught one specific type of risk while ignoring dozens of other fraud indicators we cared about.</p> \n \n<p>The fundamental issue was that we had excellent observability tools, structured data systems, and experienced risk analysts, but the connective tissue between all these components was human labor. Scaling meant hiring more agents, which meant more inconsistency, higher cost, and no improvement in detection speed or accuracy.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Phase 1: The n8n Prototype - When Visual Orchestration Hits Its Limits</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>We started with n8n, a visual workflow automation platform, to quickly prototype and validate our hypothesis. Within weeks, we had a working proof-of-concept integrating webhook ingestion, merchant metadata fetching, website content review via multimodal AI, domain lookups, GST enrichment, fraud metrics, and LLM-based risk analysis.</p> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgqjfn2uho4pyhh2pn9we.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgqjfn2uho4pyhh2pn9we.png\" alt=\"bumblebee-n8n-workflow\" width=\"800\" height=\"47\"></a></p> \n \n<p>The prototype validated that automation was feasible and helped us identify the complete set of data points needed. However, n8n quickly revealed fundamental limitations: <strong>branch explosion</strong> (handling edge cases created unmaintainable 40-node workflows with duplicated logic), <strong>observability gaps</strong> (debugging failed nodes was painful with coarse logs), and <strong>platform instability</strong> (non-deterministic behavior in HTTP and merge operations). The n8n prototype taught us that production-grade risk automation would require a code-first approach with proper observability and the ability to use Python libraries directly.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Phase 2: Python + ReAct Agent - Better Control, New Bottlenecks</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>We rebuilt as a Python web application with an API frontend and task workers. This immediately solved several Phase 1 problems: native Python libraries, structured logging with trace IDs, proper exception handling with retry logic, and complex NLP preprocessing capabilities.</p> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0g0sjs9puoe27ldedilz.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0g0sjs9puoe27ldedilz.png\" alt=\"bumblebee-sequence-diagram\" width=\"800\" height=\"733\"></a></p> \n \n<p>The core was a single ReAct-style agent that iteratively reasoned about which tools to call, executed them, and incorporated results until producing a structured risk assessment. Phase 2 brought full observability, easy tool addition, and dynamic behavior that replaced brittle conditional logic.</p> \n \n<p>However, new bottlenecks emerged. <strong>Token bloat</strong> became critical as the agent accumulated 50KB+ of HTML content, domain data, and fraud metrics in its context window, regularly hitting token limits. <strong>Sequential execution</strong> meant tool invocations happened one after another even when they had no dependencies, scaling linearly with tool count. <strong>Temperature conflation</strong> forced a compromise setting that was suboptimal for both exploration (tool selection) and exploitation (final scoring). Phase 2 proved agentic orchestration was right, but single-agent architecture couldn't scale to thousands of concurrent evaluations.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Phase 3: Multi-Agent Architecture - When Specialization Wins</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>The breakthrough came when we stopped treating fraud detection as a single AI task and started building a <strong>multi-agent collaboration system</strong>. Rather than one agent doing everything, we split responsibilities across specialized agents optimized for specific roles: Planner, Fetchers, and Analyzer.</p> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F74bokg78giaw38ehj9ml.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F74bokg78giaw38ehj9ml.png\" alt=\"bumblebee-multiagent-arch\" width=\"800\" height=\"503\"></a></p> \n \n<p><strong>The Planner Agent</strong> receives the merchant case, examines available tools, checks system health and API quotas, and generates an execution plan. This isn't a rigid script; it's a structured specification of what information to gather, with priorities, timeouts, token budgets, and expected schemas. The Planner enforces business rules deterministically. Skip GST validation for non-Indian merchants. Deprioritize social media checks for B2B merchants where social presence matters less. This reduces unnecessary API calls and focuses resources on high-signal checks.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Data Fetcher Agents</strong> execute in parallel, each owning one data source or tool. Website scraping, WHOIS lookups, fraud database queries, social media metrics, pricing comparisons, policy verification. Here's the critical insight: fetchers don't just retrieve raw data. They perform <strong>local data pruning</strong> before returning results.</p> \n \n<p>The website content reviewer doesn't send back 50KB of HTML. It extracts only relevant sections: privacy policies, contact information, pricing tables, product descriptions. Using keyword matching or lightweight NLP models, it returns a compact JSON payload with structured snippets, confidence scores, and provenance links. This solves the token bloat problem. Instead of accumulating full raw outputs, the system maintains small, information-dense summaries.</p> \n \n<p>Each fetcher compresses its domain's data into a format optimized for downstream analysis. Fetchers also implement caching for data that doesn't change frequently. WHOIS information and domain reputation scores get cached with appropriate TTLs, reducing redundant external API calls and improving throughput during traffic spikes.</p> \n \n<p><strong>The Analyzer Agent</strong> consumes these structured payloads and produces the final risk assessment. It runs <strong>deterministic rules first</strong>: hard thresholds for fraud metrics, blacklist checks, compliance violations. These rules are fast, explainable, and don't require LLM inference.</p> \n \n<p>Only after deterministic rules does the Analyzer invoke the LLM for interpretive tasks: generating human-readable summaries, explaining why certain indicators triggered, identifying nuanced patterns that don't fit simple rules. Because fetchers already pruned and structured the data, the Analyzer's LLM calls work with minimal context, avoiding token limit issues entirely.</p> \n \n<p>Different agents use different temperature settings tuned for their roles. The Planner runs at medium temperature for flexible tool selection. The Analyzer uses very low temperature for deterministic risk scoring and higher temperature when generating business narratives where creative expression improves readability. This per-agent temperature control eliminates the compromises from Phase 2.</p> \n \n<p><strong>The execution model</strong> leverages Celery for orchestration. When a case arrives, the API enqueues a planning job. The Planner generates the execution plan and enqueues multiple fetcher jobs in parallel. As fetchers complete, their results stream into a shared state store. The Analyzer subscribes to fetcher completion events and begins processing as soon as enough data is available, not waiting for every fetcher if some are slow or failing.</p> \n \n<p>If a fetcher fails entirely (website unreachable, API rate-limiting), the Planner degrades gracefully. The Analyzer proceeds with available data and flags the missing information for manual review rather than blocking the entire evaluation. This resilience was impossible in Phase 2's sequential architecture.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>The Results: When Architecture Meets Reality</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>The shift to multi-agent architecture produced measurable improvements across every dimension. <strong>Token usage dropped 60%</strong> through fetcher-level pruning and elimination of full raw data in LLM context. <strong>End-to-end latency fell from 35 seconds to 8-12 seconds</strong> via parallel fetcher execution and focused LLM calls. <strong>Success rate rose from 88% to 99%+</strong>, measured as cases completing without token limits or LLM failures.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Cost per evaluation decreased</strong> despite adding sophisticated analysis. Smaller context windows meant cheaper LLM calls. Caching at the fetcher level reduced external API expenses. The system now handles thousands of concurrent evaluations without bottlenecking, scaling horizontally by adding task workers rather than vertically with bigger servers.</p> \n \n<p>The most important improvement is <strong>maintainability and extensibility</strong>. Adding a new risk signal requires writing a new fetcher agent with its pruning logic and output schema. The Planner automatically incorporates new tools once registered. The Analyzer adapts to new data sources without modification. This composability enables continuous fraud detection improvement by adding signals incrementally rather than requiring architectural rewrites.</p> \n \n<p>The multi-agent approach provides <strong>observability impossible in earlier phases</strong>. Each agent logs trace IDs, tokens consumed, latency, confidence scores, and reasoning. When a case produces unexpected results, we replay the exact sequence of fetcher outputs, examine what the Analyzer saw, and understand why it reached that conclusion. This audit trail is critical for debugging, regulatory compliance, and explaining decisions to merchants who dispute risk assessments.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>What We Learned: Principles for Building Production AI Agents</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Our journey from n8n through ReAct to multi-agent orchestration taught us several lessons that apply broadly to anyone building AI systems for production use cases.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Start simple, evolve deliberately</strong>. N8n was the right choice for Phase 1 even though we knew it wouldn't scale. Rapid prototyping and stakeholder validation matter more than architectural purity in early stages. What's critical is recognizing when you've outgrown your current approach and having the discipline to rebuild rather than patch over fundamental limitations.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Token budgets are real constraints</strong>. Many blog posts about AI agents gloss over token management, but in production systems with large, messy real-world data, token limits are where architectures break. Design explicitly for token efficiency: prune early, prune often, and never pass raw, unstructured data to LLMs when you can send structured summaries instead.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Specialization beats generalization at scale</strong>. A single agent trying to handle planning, data fetching, and analysis will hit walls that can't be solved with better prompts or bigger models. Splitting responsibilities across specialized agents with clear interfaces between them produces systems that are faster, more reliable, and easier to understand.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Temperature is not a hyperparameter you tune once</strong>. Different tasks need different temperature settings, and trying to find a compromise temperature for a single agent produces mediocre results everywhere. Per-agent temperature control is a fundamental architectural requirement, not an optimization detail.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Parallelism matters more than model size</strong>. Running multiple smaller, focused agents in parallel often outperforms running one large agent sequentially, both in terms of latency and cost. This runs counter to the instinct to throw the biggest model available at every problem.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Observability is not optional</strong>. Without structured logging, trace IDs, and the ability to replay decision sequences, debugging production AI systems is nearly impossible. Invest in observability infrastructure early, ideally before you have a production incident that requires it.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>The Path Forward: Continuous Improvement by Design</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>What makes the multi-agent architecture particularly powerful is that it's designed for continuous improvement. As we accumulate more cases, we can identify patterns where the Analyzer produces low-confidence results or where human reviewers frequently override AI decisions. These cases become training data for improving fetcher pruning heuristics, refining Planner rules, and tuning Analyzer prompts.</p> \n \n<p>We're exploring several extensions. Fine-tuning small, specialized models for specific fetchers rather than relying entirely on general-purpose LLMs. This could further reduce cost and latency while improving accuracy for domain-specific tasks like policy compliance checking. Implementing feedback loops where human overrides automatically update Planner rules or Analyzer thresholds, creating a self-improving system that gets smarter as risk operators correct its mistakes.</p> \n \n<p>Another direction is adding <strong>predictive agents</strong> that don't just evaluate merchant risk at onboarding but continuously monitor for behavioral changes that might indicate fraud. Imagine fetchers running periodically in the background, detecting when a merchant's website content changes significantly, when pricing diverges from competitors, or when social media presence suddenly evaporates. The same multi-agent architecture that handles point-in-time evaluation can drive continuous risk monitoring with minimal modification.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Why This Matters Beyond Fraud Detection</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>I've been talking about merchant risk evaluation specifically, but the architectural patterns we discovered apply broadly to any domain where AI agents need to process large amounts of heterogeneous data, make complex decisions, and produce explainable results. Financial services, healthcare, supply chain management, cybersecurity, and legal research all have similar characteristics: multiple data sources with different formats and latencies, domain expertise encoded in rules and models, and requirements for auditability and compliance.</p> \n \n<p>The lesson isn't \"use multi-agent architecture for everything.\" The lesson is that as AI systems scale from demos to production, the architecture that got you to the first prototype often becomes the main thing preventing you from scaling further. Having the discipline to recognize when you've hit architectural limits, the willingness to rebuild from first principles, and the engineering rigor to measure improvements objectively separates successful production AI from expensive science projects.</p> \n \n<p>At Razorpay, we've taken fraud detection from a manual, inconsistent process consuming 800 agent hours monthly to an automated system that evaluates merchants in seconds with higher accuracy and comprehensive audit trails. We've reduced our per-review time by 75%, improved detection consistency, and freed up risk operators to focus on genuinely complex cases that require human judgment. And we've done it with an architecture that gets better over time rather than more fragile.</p> \n \n<p>If you're building AI agents for production use cases, the technology is ready. The LLMs are capable, the orchestration frameworks exist, and the integration tools work. The hard part is designing systems that handle real-world messiness, scale with your business, and maintain reliability when things inevitably break. That's where architecture matters, and that's what we learned the hard way through three iterations of building Agentic Risk.</p> \n \n<p><em>editor: <a href=\"https://dev.to/paaarth96\">@paaarth96</a></em> </p>"

Due to privacy constraints and limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward content-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information. However, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text, neglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic completeness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose OMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective, Method, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning, and structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style summarization module converts raw papers into structured and discourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives align semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels. The final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through contextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly constructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in Precision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that QA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete representations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable content-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing trustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval."

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance."

However, path planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant challenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and robust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a geometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure in complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome these limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a semantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots (SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages high-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable planning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window mechanism, inspired by the \"fast\" and \"slow\" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for rapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle configurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the environment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path length (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate SATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate, outperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner reduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving comparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of SATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype."

However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision.

In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates.

However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose MindRec, a diffusion-driven coarse-to-fine generative paradigm that emulates human thought processes. Built upon a diffusion language model, MindRec departs from auto-regressive generation by leveraging a masked diffusion process to reconstruct items in a flexible, non-sequential manner. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling adaptive and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\\% average improvement in top-1 accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation performance.

    "content": "Music Recommender Systems (MRS) have long relied on an information-retrieval framing, where progress is measured mainly through accuracy on retrieval-oriented subtasks. While effective, this reductionist paradigm struggles to address the deeper question of what makes a good recommendation, and attempts to broaden evaluation, through user studies or fairness analyses, have had limited impact. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) disrupts this framework: LLMs are generative rather than ranking-based, making standard accuracy metrics questionable. They also introduce challenges such as hallucinations, knowledge cutoffs, non-determinism, and opaque training data, rendering traditional train/test protocols difficult to interpret. At the same time, LLMs create new opportunities, enabling natural-language interaction and even allowing models to act as evaluators. This work argues that the shift toward LLM-driven MRS requires rethinking evaluation. We first review how LLMs reshape user modeling, item modeling, and natural-language recommendation in music.

    "content": "Although the collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm has achieved remarkable performance in recommendation systems, it suffers from suboptimal recommendation performance due to noise in the user-item interaction matrix. Numerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most existing approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause attenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can interrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel GNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD includes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes signals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise denoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the information aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is modified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling operation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that DRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves statistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models."

To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology for constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query generation. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline combines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and reasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger alignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology, we construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking documents. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with the complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our systematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring the need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains."

The sequence of a user's historical questions provides a rich, implicit signal of evolving interests and cognitive patterns, yet leveraging this temporal data for predictive tasks remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between language modeling and behavioral sequence modeling. To bridge this gap, we propose a Collaborative Filtering-enhanced Question Prediction (CFQP) framework. CFQP dynamically models evolving user-question interactions by integrating personalized memory modules with graph-based preference propagation. This dual mechanism allows the system to adaptively learn from user-specific histories while refining predictions through collaborative signals from similar users.

Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%).

Through rigorous benchmarking on a large Wikipedia subgraph, we demonstrate that a purely greedy agent guided by the semantic similarity of article titles is overwhelmingly effective. This strategy, when combined with a simple loop-avoidance mechanism, achieved a perfect success rate and navigated the network with an efficiency an order of magnitude better than structural or hybrid methods.

A key innovation of our model is the introduction of a one-dimensional convolution-based token compression module. We dynamically adjust the compression rate during training, enabling the model to learn more robust and efficient compressed text representations. By combining knowledge distillation with token compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in both embedding quality and inference efficiency.

We propose Federated Recommendation with Knowledge Guidance (FedRKG), a model-agnostic framework that resolves this dilemma. The core principle, Knowledge Guidance, avoids full replacement and instead fuses global knowledge into preserved local embeddings, attaining the personalization benefits of dual-knowledge within a single-knowledge memory footprint. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Guidance, a fine-grained mechanism that dynamically modulates the intensity of this guidance for each user-item interaction, overcoming the limitations of static fusion methods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedRKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios.

Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness."

To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner. Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes."

These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors."

We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps."

    "content": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integrated into high-stakes domains, there is a growing need for evaluation methods that are both scalable for real-time deployment and reliable for critical decision-making. While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains."

The usual story: you read a bunch of tables, join them together, run several preprocessing steps where the output of one step becomes the input of another, and meanwhile, requirements keep changing --&gt; new rules, new table names, renamed columns, and so on.</p>  \n  \n<p>Recently, I had to refactor a client function that was doing exactly this. It received several Spark DataFrames as input and was supposed to return one “clean” transactions DataFrame, ready to be written to the database. Inside, it was basically just calling a chain of helper functions in a fixed order. Each helper returned a DataFrame that either contributed to the final result or was used as input for some other step further down the pipeline.</p>  \n  \n<p>The problem was that everything was tightly coupled. Each helper depended (sometimes implicitly) on what the previous helpers were doing. Changing a single line in one of them meant double-checking a lot of other functions to make sure nothing broke. It was fragile, and refactoring was painful.</p>  \n  \n<p>In situations like this, the Builder design pattern turned out to be a lifesaver for me. It’s very handy when the object you want to build is the result of several processing steps, not just a few fields assigned inside an <code>__init__</code>. If you want a proper deep dive into the pattern itself, I recommend this page: <a href=\"https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder\">https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder</a>. I first studied it in the book <em>Python Design Patterns</em> by Ayeva and Kasampalis, which I’d also recommend.</p>  \n  \n<p>In the example below, we’ll define:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>a <strong>Transactions</strong> class – with very little responsibility: it just defines the attributes that make up our final object (raw inputs, intermediate tables, final output);</li>  \n<li>a <strong>TransactionsBuilderType1</strong> class – which receives the input DataFrames, creates a Transactions instance, and exposes the methods that progressively build each attribute;</li>  \n<li>a <strong>Director</strong> class – which knows the builder interface, has one main method that runs the builder steps in the right order, and exposes a method/property to return the final Transactions object once everything is done.  \n</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code>  \nclass Transactions:  \n    def __init__(self, input_table_1, input_table_2):  \n        self.raw_input_table_1 = input_table_1  \n        self.raw_input_table_2 = input_table_2  \n  \n        self.preprocessed_table_1 = None  \n        self.preprocessed_table_2 = None  \n  \n        # Final ETL output table (e.g. cleaned, enriched transactions)  \n        self.preprocessed_transactions = None  \n  \n  \nclass TransactionsBuilderType1:  \n    def __init__(self, input_table_1, input_table_2):  \n        self.transactions = Transactions(  \n            input_table_1=input_table_1,  \n            input_table_2=input_table_2,  \n        )  \n        ... # other builder-related attributes (configs, parameters, etc.)  \n  \n    def preprocess_table_1(self):  \n        # Business logic to preprocess input_table_1  \n        self.transactions.preprocessed_table_1 = ...  \n  \n    def preprocess_table_2(self):  \n        # Business logic to preprocess input_table_2  \n        self.transactions.preprocessed_table_2 = ...  \n  \n    def compute_final_table(self):  \n        # Use preprocessed tables to compute the final transactions table   \n        # (like self.preprocess_table_1.join(self.preprocess_table_2) etc.)  \n        self.transactions.preprocessed_transactions = ...   \n  \n  \nclass Director:  \n    def __init__(self):  \n        self.builder = None  \n  \n    def construct_transactions(self, builder):  \n        self.builder = builder  \n        steps = [  \n            self.builder.preprocess_table_1,  \n            self.builder.preprocess_table_2,  \n            self.builder.compute_final_table,  \n        ]  \n  \n        for step in steps:  \n            step()  \n  \n    @property  \n    def transactions(self):  \n        # Return the fully built Transactions object  \n        return self.builder.transactions  \n  \n  \n# client code:  \n  \ninput_table_1 = spark.table(...)  \ninput_table_2 = spark.table(...)  \nbuilder = TransactionsBuilderType1(input_table_1, input_table_2)  \ndirector = Director()  \ndirector.construct_transactions(builder)  \n  \npreprocessed_transactions = director.transactions.preprocessed_transactions  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<p>Let me know your thoughts!<br>  \nThanks.</p>  \n  \n<p>Cristian Bergamo</p>"

I recently stumbled upon Vanna.ai, and it immediately stood out. At its core, <strong>Vanna.ai</strong> is a powerful agent designed to turn natural language questions into data insights. It achieves this by acting as a translator: taking a question from a user, converting it into valid SQL, executing that query against your database, and delivering the answer back in a rich format. More than just a simple query generator, Vanna 2.0 seems to be built for production, offering features like user-aware security, streaming responses (including interactive data tables and charts), and seamless integration with virtually any LLM (including open-source models like Granite and gpt-oss (among others…) and (almost) any database.</p> \n \n<p>As I mentioned, Vanna.ai seems to be fit for more than Text2SQL… but I stick to this part for my tests. You can refer to their site provided in “Links” to discover more. <strong>Last but not least; I have no affiliation with them!</strong></p> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmlwlw0oqao67wk73p06h.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmlwlw0oqao67wk73p06h.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"467\"></a></p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Implementation and Tests \n</h2> \n \n<p>The magic of Vanna’s solution resides in their powerful, agent-based package, which handles everything from authenticating the user to selecting the right tools — like the <code>RunSqlTool</code>—to safely query the database and generate the final visualization. This robust architecture is the foundation of the sample application we'll be exploring from their site. So, let's jump into the test and coding steps!</p> \n \n<p><strong>To</strong> properly test Vanna’s capabilities and demonstrate its Text-to-SQL functionality, we first need a working environment with a database containing meaningful data. For maximum simplicity and portability, I chose to create and populate a SQLite database. As a file-based SQL engine, SQLite eliminates the need for a separate server setup, making it the fastest and easiest way to get our Users and Commands tables ready for the Vanna agent to query.</p>

While I wasn’t aiming to conduct rigorous, side-by-side benchmarking, this functionality test confirms the core power of using Vanna.ai with these locally hosted open-source models.

Two hours later, your logs are filled with parsing failures and users cannot complete actions because \"Invalid JSON\" errors are popping up everywhere. The AI gave you working code, but the problem is that it only worked in your controlled test environment with your specific input.</p> \n \n<p>It happened to me so many times I lost count, so I’m going to share one of the best ways to get your AI to generate valid json, every single time.</p> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flt9g6nxaevfcah1x6hkb.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flt9g6nxaevfcah1x6hkb.png\" alt=\"Consistent JSON Output System\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\"></a></p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Bad JSON Means High Costs \n</h2> \n \n<p>When you are building features that depend on structured data like API integrations, database operations, or configuration files, JSON consistency directly determines whether your app works or breaks. A single malformed response can quickly cascade into hundreds of failed user actions, corrupt database writes, and support tickets flooding your inbox.</p> \n \n<p>While AI generates JSON that looks correct during development, production environments expose inconsistencies like missing commas, trailing commas in strict parsers, unescaped quotes in user-generated content, and Unicode characters from international users. These small formatting errors crash entire features, so you need AI to output valid and production-ready JSON consistently instead of just succeeding in your local tests.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The Airport Security Model \n</h2> \n \n<p>Airport security examines your documents multiple times at check-in, security, and the gate because mistakes are expensive to fix later. JSON validation works the same way because AI generates structurally sound JSON in controlled conditions but often breaks under real-world variance. That’s why you need to build multiple validation checkpoints to catch these errors.</p> \n \n<p>Most builders stop at the prompt, but production-ready apps require five distinct checkpoints to ensure reliability.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The Most Common Ways AI Breaks Your Data \n</h2> \n \n<p><strong>Syntax Errors:</strong> Missing or extra commas, brackets, or quotes break <code>JSON.parse()</code> immediately on your server. For example, AI often adds a trailing comma after the last object property or forgets to close a nested object properly. While some lenient parsers might handle this, standard Node.js or Python backends will throw an exception and crash the request before your logic even runs.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Escaped Character Traps:</strong> One of the most insidious errors occurs when AI double-escapes characters inside the JSON string itself (e.g., returning <code>\\\\\"</code> instead of <code>\\\"</code>). This technically creates a valid string but invalid JSON content for your parser, causing it to fail when processing fields that contain quotes, backslashes, or special characters.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Structure Mismatch:</strong> This happens when you get valid JSON in the wrong shape, such as receiving <code>{\"title\": \"My Article\"}</code> when you actually need <code>{\"article\": {\"title\": \"My Article\"}}</code>. Your backend code expects nested objects but receives flat structures, which causes undefined property errors that can take down your entire API endpoint.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Type Confusion:</strong> AI sometimes returns strings when you need numbers or arrays when you need objects. This results in valid JSON with broken logic. An example is when a count field comes back as <code>\"25\"</code> (string) instead of <code>25</code> (number), which breaks database schema validation and any math operations you perform on that data.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Truncated Responses:</strong> When you request a large dataset, some models will hit their output token limit and cut off the JSON mid-stream (e.g., ending with <code>...</code> or just stopping). This leaves you with an incomplete, unparsable string. The reliable fix is to request data in smaller chunks—generating multiple subsets and concatenating the results in your code rather than asking for one massive payload.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The 5-Checkpoint Framework for Bulletproof JSON \n</h2> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fozkxat662nvsirl28qtd.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fozkxat662nvsirl28qtd.png\" alt=\"The Validation Checkpoint System\" width=\"800\" height=\"446\"></a></p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  1.

Provide a JSON Schema \n</h2> \n \n<p><strong>The most reliable way to get consistent JSON structure is to give AI an exact schema to follow.</strong></p> \n \n<p>JSON Schema defines the structure, types, and requirements for your data. Instead of describing what you want in natural language, you provide a formal specification that eliminates ambiguity.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Add this to your prompt:</strong></p> \n \n<p>\"Return JSON matching this exact schema.

Request Code Fences \n</h2> \n \n<p>Add to your prompt: \"Wrap the JSON in markdown code fences with json syntax highlighting\"</p> \n \n<p><strong>This prevents AI from adding explanatory text before or after the JSON because extra text breaks parsing when you extract the response.</strong></p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  4.

AI models are trained to be conversational and often add context before JSON blocks, so you must always request \"ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.\"</p> \n \n<p><strong>🚩 Nested objects are inconsistent:</strong> AI formats the first object correctly but makes errors in deeply nested structures. The model's attention weakens as JSON depth increases, which leads to malformed brackets and missing commas three or four levels deep.</p> \n \n<p><strong>🚩 Numbers as strings:</strong> AI often wraps numbers in quotes because it sees numbers as text tokens rather than numeric types. You need to be explicit that \"count should be a number, not a string.\"</p> \n \n<p><strong>🚩 Double-escaped characters in strings:</strong> AI returns <code>\\\\\"</code> instead of <code>\\\"</code> for quotes inside strings because the model treats escape sequences as text patterns rather than functional syntax.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Watch Out For Escaped Character \n</h2> \n \n<p><strong>One of the most frustrating JSON issues occurs when AI returns responses with escaped characters inside the JSON itself.</strong></p> \n \n<p><strong>Example of what goes wrong:</strong></p> \n \n<ul> \n<li> \n<strong>What you expect:</strong> <code>{\"title\": \"The \\\"Best\\\" Guide\"}</code> \n</li> \n<li> \n<strong>What AI sometimes returns:</strong> <code>{\"title\": \"The \\\\\\\"Best\\\\\\\" Guide\"}</code> \n</li> \n</ul> \n \n<p><strong>The AI double-escapes quotes, backslashes, and special characters.</strong> When you parse this JSON, you get literal backslash characters in your strings instead of properly escaped quotes. This breaks things when you try to display the data to users or pass it to other systems that expect clean strings.</p> \n \n<p><strong>How to prevent it:</strong></p> \n \n<p>Add to your prompt: <strong>\"Use proper JSON escaping. Quotes inside strings should use single backslash escape (\"), not double backslash (\\\").\"</strong></p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Hidden Edge Cases \n</h2> \n \n<p><strong>Trailing commas:</strong> AI adds commas after the last item in objects or arrays. Strict JSON parsers reject this immediately even though JavaScript often accepts it, so this breaks in production environments using different parsers.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Unescaped special characters:</strong> If your data contains quotes or backslashes, AI often forgets to escape them. A title like \"O'Brien's Guide\" will break your JSON when AI returns <code>\"title\": \"O'Brien's Guide\"</code> instead of <code>\"title\": \"O\\'Brien's Guide\"</code> if your parser is strict about apostrophes.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Inconsistent null handling:</strong> AI randomly switches between <code>null</code>, <code>\"null\"</code>, empty string, or omitting the field entirely. Your application logic assumes one pattern but receives variations, which causes conditional checks to fail unpredictably.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  My Production Safety Net \n</h2> \n \n<p>You have likely spent an hour debugging a critical failure only to discover the culprit was a single missing comma. In production, that one missing comma is not just a syntax error. It represents hundreds of failed user requests and corrupted data that piled up before you even noticed the issue.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Here's the technique that changed everything for me:</strong></p> \n \n<p><strong>Use <code>jsonrepair</code> to automatically fix malformed JSON.</strong><br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>jsonrepair</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>jsonrepair</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> \n \n<span>try</span> <span>{</span> \n  <span>*</span><span>// Try parsing normally first*</span> \n  <span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>aiResponse</span><span>);</span> \n<span>}</span> <span>catch </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> \n  <span>*</span><span>// If parsing fails, attempt repair*</span> \n  <span>try</span> <span>{</span> \n    <span>const</span> <span>repairedJson</span> <span>=</span> <span>jsonrepair</span><span>(</span><span>aiResponse</span><span>);</span> \n    <span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>repairedJson</span><span>);</span> \n    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>JSON repaired successfully</span><span>'</span><span>);</span> \n  <span>}</span> <span>catch </span><span>(</span><span>repairError</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> \n    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Could not repair JSON:</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>repairError</span><span>);</span> \n    <span>*</span><span>// Handle the error*</span> \n  <span>}</span> \n<span>}</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>The <code>jsonrepair</code> library automatically fixes common JSON formatting issues like adding missing commas, removing trailing commas, fixing unescaped quotes, and repairing truncated JSON.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Think of it as insurance.

However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance. In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names. We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs. The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn). Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5. \n  To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG. A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases. Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability. \n  These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation."

    "content": "Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities."

Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel \"Reverse Construction\" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident.

Experimental results obtained over standard benchmarks demonstrate enhanced coverage progression from the early stages of the fuzzing process, which could be beneficial if fuzzing is employed in CI/CD pipelines at any stage of software development. Furthermore, the coordinated exchange of input corpora among clusters of fuzzers effectively addresses coverage stagnation, enabling a sustained exploration of complex and deep execution paths.

To fill this gap, we propose Agent-Kernel, a framework built upon a novel society-centric modular microkernel architecture. It decouples core system functions from simulation logic and separates cognitive processes from physical environments and action execution. Consequently, Agent-Kernel achieves superior adaptability, configurability, reliability, and reusability. We validate the framework's superiority through two distinct applications: a simulation of the Universe 25 (Mouse Utopia) experiment, which demonstrates the handling of rapid population dynamics from birth to death; and a large-scale simulation of the Zhejiang University Campus Life, successfully coordinating 10,000 heterogeneous agents, including students and faculty."

This is amplified by the fact that fuzzing campaigns often find a large number of crashing inputs, many of which share the same underlying bug. Crash deduplication is the task of finding such duplicate crashing inputs and thereby reducing the data that needs to be examined. Many existing deduplication approaches rely on comparing stack traces or other information that is collected when a program crashes. Although various metrics for measuring the similarity of such pieces of information have been proposed, many do not yield satisfactory deduplication results. In this work, we present GPTrace, a deduplication workflow that leverages a large language model to evaluate the similarity of various data sources associated with crashes by computing embedding vectors and supplying those as input to a clustering algorithm. We evaluate our approach on over 300 000 crashing inputs belonging to 50 ground truth labels from 14 different targets. The deduplication results produced by GPTrace show a noticeable improvement over hand-crafted stack trace comparison methods and even more complex state-of-the-art approaches that are less flexible."

We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model."

As a first step towards vertical integration of DuckDB and programmable SSDs, we consider whether and how DuckDB can access NVMe SSDs directly. By default, DuckDB relies on the POSIX file interface. In contrast, we rely on the xNVMe library and explore how it can be leveraged in DuckDB. We leverage the block-based nature of the DuckDB buffer manager to bypass the synchronous POSIX I/O interface, the file system and the block manager. Instead, we directly issue asynchronous I/Os against the SSD logical block address space. Our preliminary experimental study compares different ways to manage asynchronous I/Os atop xNVMe. The speed-up we observe over the DuckDB baseline is significant, even for the simplest scan query over a TPC-H table. As expected, the speed-up increases with the scale factor, and the Linux NVMe passthru improves performance. Future work includes a more thorough experimental study, a flexible solution that combines raw NVMe access and legacy POSIX file interface as well the co-design of DuckDB and SSDs."

However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns.

You'll learn how to structure, enrich, and standardize log file entries so they become first-class observability data.</p> \n \n<p>Let's begin!</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  How the Filelog receiver works \n</h2> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg30rpueploqdrubf9zil.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg30rpueploqdrubf9zil.png\" alt=\"An illustration of how filelogreceiver works in OpenTelemetry\" width=\"800\" height=\"335\"></a></p> \n \n<p>Before we get into configuration details, it helps to picture how the receiver handles a log file throughout its lifecycle. You can think of it as a simple repeating four-step loop:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li><p><strong>Discover:</strong> The receiver scans the filesystem at regular intervals, using the <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> patterns you've set, to figure out which log files it should pay attention to.</p></li> \n<li><p><strong>Read:</strong> Once a file is picked up, the receiver opens it and begins following along as new lines are written. The <code>start_at</code> setting decides whether it begins from <code>beginning</code> or just tails new content from the <code>end</code>.</p></li> \n<li><p><strong>Parse:</strong> Each line (or block of lines, if multiline parsing is used) runs through a series of <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/docs/operators/README.md\">Stanza operators</a> (if configured). These operators parse the raw text, pull out key attributes, assign timestamps and severity levels, and ultimately structure the log data.</p></li> \n<li><p><strong>Emit:</strong> Finally, the structured log records are passed into the Collector's pipeline, where they can be <a href=\"https://www.dash0.com/guides/opentelemetry-filter-processor\">filtered</a>, transformed further, or exported to your backend.</p></li> \n</ol> \n \n<p>This <code>Discover -&gt; Read -&gt; Parse -&gt; Emit</code> loop forms the foundation of everything the receiver does.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Quick Start: tailing a log file \n</h2> \n \n<p>One of the most common use cases is when your application is already writing logs in JSON format to a file. For example, imagine you have a service writing JSON logs to <code>/var/log/myapp/app.log</code>:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span>{</span><span>\"time\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"2025-09-28 20:15:12\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"level\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"INFO\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"message\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"User logged in successfully\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"user_id\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"u-123\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"source_ip\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"192.168.1.100\"</span><span>}</span><span> \n</span><span>{</span><span>\"time\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"2025-09-28 20:15:45\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"level\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"WARN\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"message\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"Password nearing expiration\"</span><span>,</span><span>\"user_id\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"u-123\"</span><span>}</span><span> \n</span></code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Here's a minimal <code>filelog</code> receiver example to read and ingest such logs into an OpenTelemetry pipeline:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span># 1.

This is controlled using <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> glob patterns.</p> \n \n<p>The receiver first uses <code>include</code> to generate a list of all potential files, then it applies the <code>exclude</code> patterns to remove any unwanted files from that list.</p> \n \n<p>Here's an example:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/apps/**/*.log</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>exclude</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>-</span> <span>/var/log/apps/**/debug.log</span> \n      <span>-</span> <span>/var/log/apps/**/*.tmp</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>In this scenario, the receiver will collect every <code>.log</code> file under <code>/var/log/apps/</code>, including subdirectories, but it will skip any file named <code>debug.log</code> and any file ending with <code>.tmp</code>.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Excluding files by modification age \n</h3> \n \n<p>If the log directory you're reading contains many existing log files, you can instruct the receiver to ignore files that have not been modified within a given time window with <code>exclude_older_than</code>:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/myapp/*.log</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>exclude_older_than</span><span>:</span> <span>24h</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>In this example, even if <code>app-2025-07-15.log</code> matches the pattern, it will be skipped if it hasn't been updated in the past 24 hours.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Parsing unstructured text with regular expressions \n</h2> \n \n<p>Most infrastructure logs don't come neatly packaged as JSON. More often, they're plain text strings that follow a loose pattern, such as web server access logs, database query logs, or operating system messages. These logs are human-readable but difficult for machines to analyze until they're given some structure.</p> \n \n<p>The Collector addresses this with the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/docs/operators/regex_parser.md\">regex_parser operator</a>. Using regular expressions with named capture groups, you can break a raw log line into meaningful fields and promote them into structured attributes.</p> \n \n<p>For example, consider an <a href=\"https://www.dash0.com/guides/nginx-logs\">NGINX access log</a> in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format\">Common Log Format</a>:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>127.0.0.1 - - [28/Sep/2025:20:30:00 +0000] \"GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1\" 200 512 \n127.0.0.1 - - [28/Sep/2025:20:30:05 +0000] \"POST /api/v1/login HTTP/1.1\" 401 128 \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>You can configure the <code>regex_parser</code> like this to parse them into structured attributes:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/nginx/access.log</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> \n    <span>operators</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>-</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>regex_parser</span> \n        <span># Use named capture groups to extract data</span> \n        <span>regex</span><span>:</span> \n          <span>'</span><span>^(?P&lt;client_ip&gt;[^</span><span> </span><span>]+)</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>\\[(?P&lt;timestamp&gt;[^\\]]+)\\]</span> \n          <span>\"(?P&lt;http_method&gt;[A-Z]+)</span><span> </span><span>(?P&lt;http_path&gt;[^</span><span> </span><span>\"]+)[^\"]*\"</span> \n          <span>(?P&lt;status_code&gt;\\d{3})</span><span> </span><span>(?P&lt;response_size&gt;\\d+)$'</span> \n        <span># Parse the extracted timestamp</span> \n        <span>timestamp</span><span>:</span> \n          <span>parse_from</span><span>:</span> <span>attributes.timestamp</span> \n          <span>layout</span><span>:</span> <span>\"</span><span>%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S</span><span> </span><span>%z\"</span> \n        <span># Map status codes to severities</span> \n        <span>severity</span><span>:</span> \n          <span>parse_from</span><span>:</span> <span>attributes.status_code</span> \n          <span>mapping</span><span>:</span> \n            <span>info</span><span>:</span> \n              <span>-</span> <span>min</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span> \n                <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>399</span> \n            <span>warn</span><span>:</span> <span>4xx</span> \n            <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>5xx</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>The core of this setup is the <code>regex</code> expression with named capture groups. Each group labels a slice of the line so the parser can turn it into an attribute: <code>client_ip</code> grabs the remote address, <code>timestamp</code> captures the bracketed time string, <code>http_method</code> and <code>http_path</code> pull the request pieces, <code>status_code</code> picks up the three-digit response code, and <code>response_size</code> records the byte count.</p> \n \n<p>Once those attributes exist, the <code>timestamp</code> field parses the <code>timestamp</code> string into a proper datetime value, and the <code>severity</code> block translates status codes into meaningful severity levels using an explicit <code>mapping</code>: 2xx and 3xx responses as <code>INFO</code>, 4xx as <code>WARN</code>, and 5xx as <code>ERROR</code>.</p> \n \n<p>Once access logs are ingested with this configuration, you'll see a structured log record with all the important pieces extracted out as attributes:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>LogRecord #0 \nObservedTimestamp: 2025-09-28 21:17:42.31729069 +0000 UTC \nTimestamp: 2025-09-28 20:30:00 +0000 UTC \nSeverityText: 200 \nSeverityNumber: Info(9) \nBody: Str(127.0.0.1 - - [28/Sep/2025:20:30:00 +0000] \"GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1\" 200 512) \nAttributes: \n     -&gt; status_code: Str(200) \n     -&gt; response_size: Str(512) \n     -&gt; log.file.name: Str(myapp.log) \n     -&gt; client_ip: Str(127.0.0.1) \n     -&gt; timestamp: Str(28/Sep/2025:20:30:00 +0000) \n     -&gt; http_method: Str(GET) \n     -&gt; http_path: Str(/api/v1/users) \nTrace ID: \nSpan ID: \nFlags: 0 \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>With a single expression and a couple of parsing steps, a flat NGINX access log is transformed into structured OpenTelemetry data. A natural next step is aligning the captured attributes with the <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/\">HTTP semantic conventions</a> through the <a href=\"https://www.dash0.com/guides/opentelemetry-attributes-processor\">attributes processor</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/transformprocessor/README.md\">transform processor</a>.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Handling multiple log formats \n</h2> \n \n<p>Log files rarely come in just one flavor. For example, you might be ingesting NGINX logs, database logs, and application logs, each with their own format.</p> \n \n<p>The cleanest way to handle this is to define a separate <code>filelog</code> receiver for each file type. Each receiver has its own parsing rules and runs independently, which keeps your setup organized and easy to debug.</p> \n \n<p>This is the best approach when the log formats are completely different and share nothing in common.<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span># NGINX access logs</span> \n  <span>filelog/nginx_access</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/nginx/access.log</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>operators</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>-</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>regex_parser</span> \n        <span># ...

They begin with a header section that holds important metadata about the entire file. Without that context, the individual log lines can be hard to interpret.</p> \n \n<p>This pattern is common with batch jobs and export processes. For example, a nightly billing run might write a fresh log file for each execution. At the top of that file you might see something like this:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code># Job-ID: job-d8e8fca2 \n# Job-Type: nightly-billing-run \n# Executed-By: scheduler-prod-1 \n# Records-To-Process: 1500 \n2025-10-08T08:20:00Z INFO: Starting billing run. \n2025-10-08T08:21:15Z INFO: Processed account #1. \n2025-10-08T08:21:16Z WARN: Account #2 has a negative balance. \n. . . \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Those first lines tell you exactly which job produced the logs that follow. If you ignore them, you lose that crucial context. The <code>header</code> feature solves this by parsing metadata from the top of the file and stamping it onto every subsequent log record.</p> \n \n<p>It defines a small, dedicated pipeline that runs only on the initial block of lines. You need to specify a regex to match which lines belong to the header. The <code>metadata_operators</code> then parse those lines into attributes which are automatically added to every log entry that follows.</p> \n \n<p>To use this feature, you need to do three things:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li> Enable the <code>filelog.allowHeaderMetadataParsing</code> feature gate: \n</li> \n</ol> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># docker-compose.yml</span> \n<span>services</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>otelcol</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>command</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>[</span> \n        <span>--config=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml</span><span>,</span> \n        <span>--feature-gates=filelog.allowHeaderMetadataParsing</span><span>,</span> \n      <span>]</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<ol> \n<li> Set <code>start_at: beginning</code> since the header has to be read from the top.</li> \n<li> Configure both the <code>header</code> rules and the main <code>operators</code> pipeline.</li> \n</ol> \n \n<p>Here's the configuration to parse the headers in the sample log file:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/jobs/*.log</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> <span># required</span> \n    <span>header</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>pattern</span><span>:</span> <span>^#</span> \n      <span>metadata_operators</span><span>:</span> \n        <span>-</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>key_value_parser</span> \n          <span>delimiter</span><span>:</span> <span>\"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>\"</span> \n          <span>pair_delimiter</span><span>:</span> <span>\"</span><span>#</span><span> </span><span>\"</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Here's what's happening:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li><p><code>pattern: ^#</code> says that any line starting with <code>#</code> belongs to the header.

If you use <code>start_at: beginning</code>, the receiver will reread all your log files and create massive duplication. With <code>start_at: end</code>, you might miss any entries written while the Collector was down.</p> \n \n<p>The way to solve this is with <strong>checkpointing</strong>. By configuring a storage extension, you instruct the <code>filelog</code> receiver to save its position in each file (the last read offset) to disk and pick up exactly where it left off.</p> \n \n<p>A conventional approach is using the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/storage/filestorage\">file_storage extension</a> for this purpose:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>extensions</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>file_storage</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>directory</span><span>:</span> <span>/var/otelcol/storage</span> \n \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/myapp/*.log</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> \n    <span># Link the receiver to the storage extension</span> \n    <span>storage</span><span>:</span> <span>file_storage</span> \n \n<span># ... processors, exporters</span> \n \n<span>service</span><span>:</span> \n  <span># The extension must be enabled in the service section</span> \n  <span>extensions</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>file_storage</span><span>]</span> \n  <span>pipelines</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>logs</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>receivers</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>filelog</span><span>]</span> \n      <span># ...</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>With the <code>storage</code> extension enabled, the receiver will:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li> On startup, check the <code>/var/otelcol/storage</code> directory for saved offsets.</li> \n<li> Resume reading from the saved offset for any file it was tracking, ensuring no data is lost or duplicated.</li> \n<li> Periodically update the storage with its latest progress.</li> \n</ol> \n \n<p>Checkpointing ensures that log collection is resilient to restarts, upgrades, and even crashes. It is a critical best practice for reliable log ingestion.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Handling log delivery failures gracefully \n</h3> \n \n<p>Checkpointing with a storage extension protects you during Collector restarts, but another common failure mode is when the receiver reads a batch successfully but fails to hand it off to the next stage.</p> \n \n<p>This can happen if an exporter can't reach its endpoint, or the <a href=\"https://www.dash0.com/guides/opentelemetry-memory-limiter-processor\">memory limiter</a> is refusing data. By default, the receiver will drop that batch of logs and move on to the next, causing silent data loss.</p> \n \n<p>To prevent this, the receiver has a built-in mechanism to retry sending failed batches. When <code>retry_on_failure</code> is enabled, the receiver will pause, wait for a configured interval, and attempt to resend the exact same batch of logs. This process repeats with an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff\">exponential backoff</a> until the batch is sent successfully or the <code>max_elapsed_time</code> is reached:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>retry_on_failure</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>enabled</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> \n      <span># Wait 5 seconds after the first failure before the first retry.</span> \n      <span>initial_interval</span><span>:</span> <span>5s</span> \n      <span># The longest the receiver will wait between retries is 30 seconds.</span> \n      <span>max_interval</span><span>:</span> <span>30s</span> \n      <span># Give up trying to send a batch after 10 minutes.</span> \n      <span>max_elapsed_time</span><span>:</span> <span>10m</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>By combining checkpointing with a robust retry policy , you'll create a highly resilient log file ingestion pipeline that can withstand both Collector restarts and temporary downstream outages or throttling.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Deleting log files after processing \n</h3> \n \n<p>Some workflows call for processing a file once and then removing it to save space and avoid reprocessing. You can enable this with <code>delete_after_read</code>, which requires <code>start_at: beginning</code>:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/archives/*.gz</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> \n    <span>delete_after_read</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>You must need also enable the <code>filelog.allowFileDeletion</code> feature gate for this to work:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># docker-compose.yml</span> \n<span>services</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>otelcol</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>command</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>[</span> \n        <span>--config=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml</span><span>,</span> \n        <span>--feature-gates=filelog.allowFileDeletion</span><span>,</span> \n      <span>]</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Finally, ensure that the files are configured to be deletable and that the Collector service has enough permissions to delete the file.

The <code>filelog</code> receiver is built to handle common rotation patterns, such as <code>app.log</code> to <code>app.log.1</code> automatically and without losing data.</p> \n \n<p>Instead of relying on filenames alone, the receiver tracks each file using a unique fingerprint derived from the first few kilobytes of content. When rotation occurs, it recognizes that the original file has been renamed, finishes reading it, and then starts fresh from the beginning of the new <code>app.log</code>.</p> \n \n<p>This behavior requires no additional configuration; it works out of the box, giving you reliable log ingestion even in environments with frequent rotations.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Reading compressed files \n</h3> \n \n<p>Many log rotation tools compress old logs to save disk space, producing files like <code>access.log.1.gz</code>. The <code>filelog</code> receiver can handle these seamlessly by decompressing them on the fly.</p> \n \n<p>To make this work, you use the <code>compression</code> setting. This tells the receiver that some or all of the files it discovers may be compressed and need to be decompressed before parsing.</p> \n \n<p>You have two main choices for the <code>compression</code> setting:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li> \n<code>gzip</code>: Treats all matched files as gzip-compressed.</li> \n<li> \n<code>auto</code>: Automatically detects compression based on file extension (currently <code>.gz</code>). This is the best option when a directory contains a mix of active, uncompressed logs and older, compressed ones.</li> \n</ul> \n \n<p>For example, if your directory has both <code>app.log</code> (active) and <code>app.log.1.gz</code> (rotated and compressed), you can configure the receiver like this:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/myapp/*</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> \n    <span># Automatically detect and decompress .gz files</span> \n    <span>compression</span><span>:</span> <span>auto</span> \n    <span>operators</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>-</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>regex_parser</span> \n        <span># ... your parsing rules</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>When working with compressed logs, there are two main things to keep in mind.</p> \n \n<p>First, the receiver assumes that compressed files can only grow by appending new data. If a file is completely rewritten, for example by taking the original content and recompressing it together with new lines, the receiver may not handle it correctly.</p> \n \n<p>Second, there's the question of fingerprinting. By default, the receiver identifies files based on their compressed bytes. This works fine in most cases, but if files are renamed or moved it can cause confusion. To make identification more reliable, you can enable the <code>filelog.decompressFingerprint</code> feature gate. With this enabled, the fingerprint is calculated from the decompressed content.<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># docker-compose.yml</span> \n<span>services</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>otelcol</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>command</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>[</span> \n        <span>--config=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml</span><span>,</span> \n        <span>--feature-gates=filelog.decompressFingerprint</span><span>,</span> \n      <span>]</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>One caution: if you turn this feature on in an existing setup, the fingerprints will change. That means compressed files that were already read may be ingested again.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Performance tuning for high-volume environments \n</h2> \n \n<p>The OTel collector <code>filelog</code> receiver's default settings are optimized for general use, but in production environments with hundreds of log files or very high throughput, you'll likely need to tune its performance.</p> \n \n<p>By default, the receiver tries to read from every matched file at once. On a system producing thousands of files, this can hog the CPU and quickly hit file handle limits.</p> \n \n<p>The <code>max_concurrent_files</code> setting puts a cap on how many files are read at the same time. The default is <code>1024</code>, but lowering this can keep your system from getting overwhelmed.</p> \n \n<p>Another key setting is <code>poll_interval</code>, which controls how often the receiver checks for new files and new log lines. The default is 200ms which means logs show up almost immediately, but CPU use goes up because the filesystem is scanned more often.</p> \n \n<p>For less critical logs or resource-constrained environments, bumping this to <code>1s</code> or even 5s can be a good trade-off as it'll reduce the polling overhead with only a negligible impact on observability for most use cases.</p> \n \n<p>Finally, unusually large log entries are guarded against through the <code>max_log_size</code> setting. It defines the largest allowed log entry, so that anything bigger gets truncated.

But some systems produce logs as a series of sequential files where processing order is critical.</p> \n \n<p>By default, the <code>filelog</code> receiver reads all matching files concurrently, which means you could end up processing them out of sequence. The <code>ordering_criteria</code> setting solves this by enforcing a strict order when reading files.</p> \n \n<p>For example, given a set of log files with the following conventions:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>batch-run-001.log \nbatch-run-002.log \nbatch-run-003.log \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog/batch_logs</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>include</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>/var/log/batch-runs/batch-run-*.log</span><span>]</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> \n    <span>ordering_criteria</span><span>:</span> \n      <span>top_n</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> \n      <span># Extract the sequence number from the filename</span> \n      <span>regex</span><span>:</span> <span>batch-run-(?P&lt;seq_num&gt;\\d+)\\.log</span> \n      <span># Sort files by the sequence number as a number, not a string</span> \n      <span>sort_by</span><span>:</span> \n        <span>-</span> <span>regex_key</span><span>:</span> <span>seq_num</span> \n          <span>sort_type</span><span>:</span> <span>numeric</span> \n          <span>ascending</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>With this setup, the receiver will discover all files matching <code>batch-run-*.log</code>, extract the sequence number from each filename, and sort the files numerically in ascending order by that sequence.</p> \n \n<p>The <code>top_n</code> property determines how many files will be tracked after applying the ordering criteria. With <code>top_n: 1</code>, only the first file (<code>batch-run-001.log</code>) will be tracked and ingested into the pipeline.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Filelog receiver tips and best practices \n</h2> \n \n<p>When troubleshooting the <code>filelog</code> receiver, a few issues come up again and again. Here's how to diagnose and fix them quickly:</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Log files are not being watched \n</h3> \n \n<p>When the Collector starts watching a file for log entries, you'll see a log like this in its output:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>2025-10-09T08:47:05.574Z        info    fileconsumer/file.go:261        Started watching file   {...} \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>If you don't see this message, or if you see the log below, it means that the receiver hasn't picked up any files yet:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>2025-10-09T09:25:20.280Z        warn    fileconsumer/file.go:49 finding files   {..., \"error\": \"no files match the configured criteria\"} \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Start by double-checking your <code>include</code>, <code>exclude</code>, and <code>exclude_older_than</code> settings to make sure your file patterns actually match the files you expect.</p> \n \n<p>Next, verify that the Collector process has permission to access both the files and their parent directories. Missing directory-level permissions are one of the most common reasons files aren't discovered or watched.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Files are watched but no log lines are read \n</h3> \n \n<p>If you can see \"Started watching file\" messages but no logs are being collected, the most common cause is the <code>start_at</code> setting. By default, it's set to <code>end</code>, which tells the receiver to start reading only new lines appended after the Collector starts.</p> \n \n<p>When you're testing with an existing file that isn't actively being written to, this means nothing will appear. To read the entire file from the start, set <code>start_at</code> to <code>beginning</code>:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code><span># otelcol.yaml</span> \n<span>receivers</span><span>:</span> \n  <span>filelog</span><span>:</span> \n    <span>start_at</span><span>:</span> <span>beginning</span> \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>This ensures the receiver processes all existing content the first time the file is discovered.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Regular expression doesn't match log lines \n</h3> \n \n<p>If your logs aren't being parsed correctly, the issue is usually with your regular expression. When this happens, the Collector often logs an error like:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>2025-10-09T09:32:14.949Z        error   helper/transformer.go:154       Failed to process entry {\"resource\": {\"service.instance.id\": \"f8ec2efd-16e9-44ad-9ed2-9f406e46719f\", \"service.name\": \"otelcol-contrib\", \"service.version\": \"0.136.0\"}, \"otelcol.component.id\": \"filelog\", \"otelcol.component.kind\": \"receiver\", \"otelcol.signal\": \"logs\", \"operator_id\": \"regex_parser\", \"operator_type\": \"regex_parser\", \"error\": \"regex pattern does not match\", \"action\": \"send\", \"entry.timestamp\": \"0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\", \"log.file.name\": \"batch-run-001.log\"} \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Before adjusting your Collector config, test the regex outside of it using a tool like <a href=\"https://regex101.com/\">Regex101</a>. Make sure to select the <strong>Golang</strong> flavor so it behaves the same way as the Collector's regex engine.</p> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmppgv21pumkd0xnc46h8.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmppgv21pumkd0xnc46h8.png\" alt=\"Regex101 being used to test OpenTelemetry Collector regular expression in Golang flavor\" width=\"800\" height=\"436\"></a></p> \n \n<p>If you're not seeing this error but your regex still isn't working, check whether the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/docs/types/on_error.md\"><code>on_error</code> parameter</a> is set to one of the <code>_quiet</code> modes. Those values suppress operator errors unless the Collector log level is set to <code>DEBUG</code>.</p> \n \n<p>Common causes of regex mismatches include invisible spaces or tabs, missing anchors (<code>^</code> or <code>$</code>), incorrect escaping, or small format differences between your log and your pattern. Double-check these details before investigating further.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Logs are duplicated after restart \n</h3> \n \n<p>If you notice duplicate logs appearing after the Collector restarts, it usually means the receiver isn't remembering where it left off. To fix this, enable a <code>storage</code> extension so the <code>filelog</code> receiver can checkpoint its position in each file.</p> \n \n<p>This allows the receiver to resume reading exactly where it stopped, preventing both data loss and duplication. Without it, the receiver will reread entire files from the start after every restart.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Final thoughts \n</h2> \n \n<p>The <code>filelog</code> receiver in OpenTelemetry is an essential bridge between traditional file-based logging (often with unstructured data) and the world of modern, structured observability.</p> \n \n<p>By mastering its core concepts of discovery, parsing with operators, and checkpointing, you can build a reliable log ingestion pipeline for any service that writes its logs to a file.</p> \n \n<p>Once you've transformed your raw text logs into well-structured OpenTelemetry data, the full observability ecosystem opens up.

This visual clarity is a significant advantage over other <em>prompt as code</em> approaches like JSON or TypeScript.</p> \n \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Why Mermaid Syntax Helps an LLM \n</h2> \n \n<p>For a Large Language Model (LLM) Mermaid syntax offers several critical advantages when processing structured information:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li>Natural language descriptions of complex systems (\"A uses B, which calls C unless D is present\") are inherently <strong>ambiguous</strong>. the LLM needs to interpret the context and resolve linguistic relationships.</li> \n<li>Mermaid syntax is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that is highly structured and unambiguous. A --&gt; B means A connects to B. This structure immediately tells the LLM the entities and the directed relationship between them, converting a natural languageinterpretation task into a simple, efficient parsing task.</li> \n<li>Mermaid allows the LLMto map the text directly to a well-defined conceptual structure (a graph, a tree, a timeline). This is analogous to how a human can immediately internalize a flowchart versus reading a dense text description.</li> \n</ul> \n \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Example: Describing a Purchase Order Process \n</h2> \n \n<p>To demonstrate the efficiency and structural clarity of adding complementary Mermaid syntax to your LLM prompt, we will analyze a common scenario: a user purchasing an item in an e-commerce system, which involves interaction between three services - <code>Frontend</code>, <code>OrderService</code>, and <code>InventoryService</code>:</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li> User clicks 'Buy' on the <strong>Frontend</strong>.</li> \n<li> <strong>Frontend</strong> sends a request to the <strong>OrderService</strong> to initiate the order.</li> \n<li> <strong>OrderService</strong> checks the stock by asking the <strong>InventoryService</strong>.</li> \n<li> <strong>InventoryService</strong> returns the stock level.</li> \n<li> If stock is available, <strong>OrderService</strong> deducts the stock from <strong>InventoryService</strong>.</li> \n<li> <strong>OrderService</strong> confirms the order back to the <strong>Frontend</strong>.</li> \n<li> <strong>Frontend</strong> shows a success message.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Textual Representation \n</h3> \n \n<blockquote> \n<p>The purchase process begins when the Frontend sends a request to the OrderService, specifying the Product ID and the desired quantity.<br><br> \nThe OrderService then takes on the responsibility of verifying inventory. It issues a call to the InventoryService to check the current stock levels for that specific product ID.<br><br> \nAfter this check, the InventoryService responds back to the OrderService with the current quantity available.<br><br> \nImportantly, the process includes a critical conditional branch: If the stock is available, the OrderService sends another message back to the InventoryService to officially deduct the purchased quantity. Following this, the OrderService sends an Order Confirmation, including the new Order ID, back to the Frontend.<br><br> \nConversely, if the stock is unavailable during the initial check, the OrderService terminates that branch and sends an immediate 'Error: Out of Stock' message back to the Frontend.<br><br> \nRegardless of the outcome of the order, the final step involves the Frontend internally displaying an appropriate success or failure message to the user.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Complementary Mermaid Sequence Diagram (DSL) \n</h3> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fqbnidz4ckz3kvnxfj1oo.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fqbnidz4ckz3kvnxfj1oo.png\" alt=\"Purchase Order Sequence Diagram\" width=\"800\" height=\"503\"></a></p> \n \n<p>What the LLM actually <em>sees</em> is not the above image but this Mermaid code:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>sequenceDiagram \n    participant F as Frontend \n    participant O as OrderService \n    participant I as InventoryService \n \n    F-&gt;&gt;O: Initiate Purchase (Product ID, Qty) \n    O-&gt;&gt;I: Check Stock (Product ID) \n    I--&gt;&gt;O: Stock Available (Qty) \n    alt Stock Available \n        O-&gt;&gt;I: Deduct Stock (Qty) \n        O--&gt;&gt;F: Order Confirmation (ID) \n    else Stock Unavailable \n        O--&gt;&gt;F: Error: Out of Stock \n    end \n    F-&gt;&gt;F: Display Success Message \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  The combined input compensates for the core weaknesses of the LLM: \n</h3> \n \n<ul> \n<li> \n<strong>Ambiguity in Text:</strong> Mermaid provides the strict, non-negotiable logic to ground the text.</li> \n<li> \n<strong>Hallucination/Creativity:</strong> Mermaid forces the model into a rigid structure (like code), constraining its creative freedom to invent steps that aren't there.</li> \n<li> \n<strong>Losing Track in Long Context:</strong> The diagram acts as an easy-to-parse summary.

The NopGraphQL engine introduces many novel implementation approaches that broaden GraphQL’s scope of application and enhance its practicality.</p>  \n  \n<p>For detailed documentation, see <a href=\"https://gitee.com/canonical-entropy/nop-entropy/blob/master/docs-en/dev-guide/graphql/index.md\">graphql/index.md</a></p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  I. Simplifying GraphQL Queries with Fragment Definitions  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>GraphQL requires the frontend to specify the fields to be returned, which can be cumbersome when there are many fields. In such cases, you can use the Fragment feature of the GraphQL language to define common field sets and reference these fragments in queries to simplify them.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  1.1 Add selection definitions in XMeta, prefixed with <code>F_</code>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Each backend service object in the Nop platform has an associated XMeta metadata model file, where you can augment GraphQL types with additional metadata.<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>&lt;meta&gt;</span>  \n  <span>&lt;selections&gt;</span>  \n    <span>&lt;selection</span> <span>id=</span><span>\"F_defaults\"</span><span>&gt;</span>  \n      userId, userName, status, relatedRoleList{ roleName}  \n    <span>&lt;/selection&gt;</span>  \n  <span>&lt;/selections&gt;</span>  \n<span>&lt;/meta&gt;</span>  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>By convention, only fragment definitions prefixed with <code>F_</code> are accessible from the frontend. Selections have other uses as well.</li>  \n<li>If <code>F_defaults</code> is not configured, it will be automatically inferred based on all non-lazy fields of the GraphQL type. If explicitly specified, the specified content is used.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  1.2 Reference fragments in frontend queries  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>When invoking backend services via GraphQL, you can use fragments:<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>query</span><span>{</span><span>  \n   </span><span>NopAuthUser__findList</span><span>{</span><span>  \n     </span><span>...</span><span>F_defaults</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>groupMappings</span><span>{...</span><span>F_defaults</span><span>}</span><span>  \n   </span><span>}</span><span>  \n</span><span>}</span><span>  \n</span></code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<p>Alternatively, when calling backend services via REST, use the <code>@selection</code> parameter to reference fragments:<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code>/r/NopAuthUser__findList?@selection=...F_defaults,groupMappings  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>When using REST, if <code>@selection</code> is not provided, it is equivalent to returning <code>F_defaults</code>.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p><strong>Under REST, if the selection only specifies object-level fields, it will be automatically expanded to nested levels.</strong></p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  II. Simplify Tree-structured Queries with the <code>@TreeChildren</code> Directive  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>For retrieving tree structures such as organization trees or menu trees, NopGraphQL provides an extended syntax via the directive mechanism to directly express recursive data fetching, for example:<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>  \n    </span><span>NopAuthDept_findList</span><span>{</span><span>  \n        </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span>  \n        </span><span>label</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>displayName</span><span>  \n        </span><span>children</span><span> </span><span>@TreeChildren</span><span>(</span><span>max</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>  \n    </span><span>}</span><span>  \n</span><span>}</span><span>  \n</span></code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  \n<code>@TreeChildren(max:5)</code> indicates that, following the current level’s structure, up to 5 levels will be nested.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  III. Map Type  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>GraphQL is a strongly typed framework that requires all data to have explicit type definitions, which can be inconvenient in certain dynamic scenarios. For instance, sometimes you may need to return an extensible collection to the frontend.</p>  \n  \n<p>NopGraphQL introduces a special scalar type: Map, which can be used to describe dynamic data structures. For example:<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>QueryBean</span><span>{</span><span>  \n    </span><span>filter</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Map</span><span>  \n    </span><span>orderBy</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>OrderFieldBean</span><span>]</span><span>  \n</span><span>}</span><span>  \n</span></code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  IV. XMeta Metadata Model  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>The XMeta metadata model enables many features via configuration.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  4.1 Map to existing properties via mapToProp  \n</h3>  \n  \n  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>&lt;prop</span> <span>name=</span><span>\"a\"</span> <span>mapToProp=</span><span>\"b.a\"</span><span>&gt;</span>  \n<span>&lt;/prop&gt;</span>  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>The mapToProp attribute can specify an alias for an existing property. When the frontend accesses property a, it actually retrieves the a property on the associated object b.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  4.2 Specify computed expressions directly via getter  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>In NopGraphQL, you can introduce dynamically computed fields in a BizModel service class via the <code>@BizLoader</code> annotation.<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>@BizModel</span><span>(</span><span>\"LoginApi\"</span><span>)</span>  \n<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LoginApiBizModelDelta</span> <span>{</span>  \n    <span>@BizLoader</span><span>(</span><span>autoCreateField</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>forType</span> <span>=</span> <span>LoginResult</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>)</span>  \n    <span>@LazyLoad</span>  \n    <span>public</span> <span>String</span> <span>location</span><span>(</span><span>@ContextSource</span> <span>LoginResult</span> <span>result</span><span>,</span>  \n                           <span>IServiceContext</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  \n        <span>return</span> <span>\"loc:\"</span> <span>+</span> <span>result</span><span>.</span><span>getUserInfo</span><span>().</span><span>getUserId</span><span>();</span>  \n    <span>}</span>  \n<span>}</span>  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<p>For lightweight computed expressions, defining service functions may be overly complex; in such cases, you can define them directly in XMeta via a getter expression:<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code><span>&lt;prop</span> <span>name=</span><span>\"myValue\"</span><span>&gt;</span>  \n  <span>&lt;getter&gt;</span>  \n    return entity.name + 'Ext'  \n  <span>&lt;/getter&gt;</span>  \n<span>&lt;/prop&gt;</span>  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  4.3 Field-level access control  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>In the xmeta file, you can specify <code>auth</code> settings for a <code>prop</code>:<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code>  \n<span>&lt;prop</span> <span>name=</span><span>\"xx\"</span><span>&gt;</span>  \n    <span>&lt;auth</span> <span>permissions=</span><span>\"NopAuthUser:query\"</span> <span>roles=</span><span>\"admin\"</span> <span>for=</span><span>\"read\"</span><span>/&gt;</span>  \n    <span>&lt;auth</span> <span>permissions=</span><span>\"NopAuthUser:mutation\"</span> <span>roles=</span><span>\"hr\"</span> <span>for=</span><span>\"write\"</span><span>/&gt;</span>  \n<span>&lt;/prop&gt;</span>  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>This configuration enables read/write access control at the field level. <code>for=\"read\"</code> controls read access to the field, <code>for=\"write\"</code> controls write access, and <code>for=\"all\"</code> allows both read and write.</li>  \n<li>Before performing any actual actions, the NopGraphQL engine checks access permissions for each field in the selection set, ensuring you don't end up executing business operations only to discover that certain result fields are inaccessible.</li>  \n<li>For data permissions and filter criteria for related sub-tables, see <a href=\"https://dev.to/canonical/nop-getting-started-how-to-implement-complex-queries-l98\">4-complex-query.md</a>.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  4.4 Automatically generate data dictionary text fields  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>In business development, a common requirement is to translate backend business field values into display text according to a data dictionary configuration.

    "content": "<p>AI Regulation News Today shows that around the world, AI regulation is rapidly evolving as governments race to set standards for safe and responsible AI development. A 2025 survey notes that “at least 69 countries” (including the EU) have proposed or adopted AI laws and initiatives. The European Union leads with the landmark EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation 2024/1689), adopted July 2024 and entering into force August 2024 (with most provisions effective in 2026). In Asia, China issued its first generative AI rules (“Interim Measures”) for content services, while India, Singapore and others are rolling out national AI strategies and sector-specific guidelines. International bodies reinforce these efforts: the UN recently encouraged countries to adopt AI rules for “safe, secure and trustworthy” systems, and organizations like the OECD have AI Principles promoting trustworthy AI globally. </p> \n \n<p><strong>Key highlights include:</strong><br> \n• <strong>EU AI Act (2024):</strong> First-ever comprehensive AI law across the 27-member bloc. It takes a risk-based approach to AI systems and will impose fines up to 7% of global turnover for non-compliance.<br> \n• C*<em>hina’s Interim Measures:</em>* New administrative rules govern generative AI service providers in China’s digital ecosystem.<br> \n• <strong>International Frameworks:</strong> Bodies like the OECD and G7 emphasize AI ethics, and the UN’s AI resolutions call for member states to enact national AI regulations.</p> \n \n<p><strong>U.S. AI Regulation 2025: Trump’s Approach</strong><br> \n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5vrn97ljlcjgps1b2vj0.jpg\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5vrn97ljlcjgps1b2vj0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\"></a><br> \nThe United States still has no single federal AI law, relying instead on a patchwork of laws and guidelines. In early 2025 the Trump administration took a markedly different tack from the previous (Biden) administration. President Trump’s January 2025 Executive Order “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI” revoked many of Biden’s AI directives. Trump’s order calls for all agencies to rescind policies seen as hindering U.S. AI dominance. <br> \nIn July 2025 the administration also released “America’s AI Action Plan”, outlining 90+ actions to boost AI innovation and leadership. This plan has a pro‑innovation, deregulatory bent – contrasting with the EU’s risk-based model and even some state AI laws (like Colorado’s AI Act) that focus on preventing bias. <br> \nMeanwhile, Congress is considering various AI bills, most aiming to issue voluntary guidelines or create new agencies. In practice, U.S. companies navigate a maze of rules: current federal laws (e.g. consumer protection, aviation or defense statutes) apply in limited ways, and agencies like the FTC and FCC are adapting existing mandates to cover AI.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Key points in U.S. federal AI policy include:</strong><br> \n<a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frjljznym6euwvnz9g3t4.jpg\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frjljznym6euwvnz9g3t4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"433\"></a></p> \n \n<ul> \n<li> \n<strong>Trump’s 2025 EO (“Removing Barriers”):</strong> Signaled a permissive, growth-focused stance. It rescinds Biden’s Oct 2023 AI EO (Safe, Secure &amp; Trustworthy AI) and directs agencies to withdraw any “obstacles” to AI development.</li> \n<li> \n<strong>American AI Action Plan (July 2025)</strong>: Lists over 90 federal initiatives to secure U.S. AI leadership. It emphasizes export of AI tech, infrastructure upgrades, and incentives for industry.</li> \n<li> \n<strong>No Comprehensive Law Yet:</strong> Developers still operate under existing statutes. As one legal update notes, without federal AI rules “developers and deployers of AI systems will operate in an increasing patchwork of state and local laws”. Federal lawmakers to date favor voluntary standards (for example, promoting AI safety research and transparency) rather than stringent mandates, to avoid stifling innovation.</li> \n</ul> \n \n<p><strong>State AI Laws in the U.S.</strong><br> \nAt the state level, Ai legislative activity is surging. Dozens of states have introduced AI bills, leading to a fragmented state-by-state regulatory landscape.** For example:**<br> \n• <strong>Colorado:</strong> In May 2024 Colorado passed the nation’s first AI Act, effective Feb 2026. It requires developers/deployers of “high-risk” AI systems to use reasonable care to protect consumers from “algorithmic discrimination” (unlawful bias) in areas like hiring, credit, healthcare, etc...<br> \n• <strong>California:</strong> In 2024 California legislators drafted dozens of AI-related bills on topics like transparency of AI-generated content, rights of people depicted in AI media, data privacy, and banning deceptive deepfakes. These add to the U.S. regulatory patchwork. (A White &amp; Case analysis notes CA’s laws “aim to impose wide-ranging obligations” on AI developers, covering everything from safety reporting to content disclosures.)<br> \n• <strong>Other States:</strong> Over 45 states considered AI measures in 2024, and 31 enacted related laws or resolutions. For instance, Utah created an AI Policy Act, New York and Illinois are moving data/biometric laws with AI provisions, and many states have task forces or guidelines.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br> \n<strong>Q: How is the U.S. handling AI regulation in 2025?</strong><br> \n<strong>A:</strong> As of 2025 the U.S. has no single AI law. The Trump administration has prioritized innovation over restriction. A January 2025 Executive Order (“Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI”) rescinded many of the Biden administration’s AI safety directives. In July 2025 the White House released an AI Action Plan with 90+ measures to boost U.S. AI leadership. At the same time, Congress has debated AI bills (mostly setting guidelines), and agencies like the FTC continue to use existing laws (e.g. anti-discrimination rules) to police AI. In practice, companies must comply with a mix of existing laws and voluntary standards, and pay close attention to state regulations.<br> \n<strong>Q: What is the EU AI Act?</strong><br> \n<strong>A:</strong> The EU Artificial Intelligence Act is the world’s first comprehensive AI law. Published in the EU Official Journal on July 12, 2024, it creates a risk-based framework for AI in all member states. High-risk AI systems (e.g. in healthcare, transport, law enforcement) will face strict requirements, while prohibited AI uses (like undetectable manipulative techniques) are banned. The law took effect in August 2024, with most rules enforceable by August 2026. It also imposes penalties up to €35 million or 7% of global turnover for violations.<br> \n<strong>Q: How many countries have AI regulations?</strong><br> \n<strong>A:</strong> By early 2025, many nations are moving on AI governance. One analysis found “at least 69 countries have proposed over 1000 AI-related policy initiatives and legal frameworks”. This includes data protection rules adapted for AI, special AI ethics laws, and government strategies. So far, major economies (EU, China, U.S.) and dozens of others (India, Canada, Australia, Brazil, etc.) have some AI rules or guidelines in place or in the works.<br> \n<strong>Q: Which U.S. states have their own AI laws?</strong><br> \n<strong>A:</strong> Several states are active. Colorado passed a landmark AI Act in 2024, targeting bias: it requires impact assessments and care to avoid “algorithmic discrimination” by high-risk AI systems. California has introduced many AI bills (e.g. requiring disclosures on AI-generated content) and broader AI/transparency laws. Utah, New York, and Illinois, among others, have new laws or regulations affecting AI use (from autonomous vehicles to biometric data). In 2024 over 30 states enacted AI-related laws or resolutions, so companies should track the state landscape carefully.<br> \n<strong>Q: What did President Trump’s 2025 AI executive order do?</strong><br> \n<strong>A:</strong> President Trump’s Jan 2025 EO titled “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” reversed many Biden-era AI policies. It revokes Biden’s Oct 2023 AI EO and directs federal agencies to rescind any rules or guidance seen as stifling innovation. The order explicitly emphasizes maintaining U.S. global AI dominance and calls for a new AI Action Plan (published in July 2025). In practice, it signals a shift from the prior administration’s risk- and safety-focused approach toward a deregulation stance.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Conclusion: Why AI Regulation News Today Matters More Than Ever</strong><br> \nThe rise of AI regulation is no longer a distant policy discussion—it’s a pressing reality shaping our digital lives, economies, and futures. From u.s. ai regulation 2025 under the Trump administration’s innovation-first stance, to a growing network of state ai laws like those in Colorado and California, the legal landscape is shifting fast. Meanwhile, international frameworks and ai regulations around the world 2025—like the EU AI Act or China’s content rules—are setting powerful precedents.<br> \nWhether you’re a business leader deploying AI tools, a developer writing algorithms, or a consumer curious about artificial intelligence laws and regulations, staying informed is critical. These laws affect how your data is used, how prices are set, and what kind of technologies get released (or banned). Understanding the regulatory direction can help you act responsibly, innovate ethically, and protect both user trust and long-term success.</p> \n \n<p>At TechDecodedly, we’re committed to delivering accurate, human-readable updates on AI regulations around the world, U.S. AI action plans, and the future of tech policy.

    "content": "<p>The corner shop that predicts your shopping habits better than Amazon. The local restaurant that automates its supply chain with the precision of McDonald's. The one-person consultancy that analyses data like McKinsey. These scenarios aren't science fiction—they're the emerging reality as artificial intelligence democratises tools once exclusive to corporate giants. But as small businesses gain access to enterprise-grade capabilities, a fundamental question emerges: will AI truly level the playing field, or simply redraw the battle lines in ways we're only beginning to understand?</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The New Arsenal \n</h2> \n \n<p>Walk into any high street business today and you'll likely encounter AI working behind the scenes. The local bakery uses machine learning to optimise flour orders. The independent bookshop employs natural language processing to personalise recommendations. The neighbourhood gym deploys computer vision to monitor equipment usage and predict maintenance needs. What was once the exclusive domain of Fortune 500 companies—sophisticated data analytics, predictive modelling, automated customer service—is now available as a monthly subscription.</p> \n \n<p>This transformation represents more than just technological advancement; it's a fundamental shift in the economic architecture. According to research from the Brookings Institution, AI functions as a \"wide-ranging\" technology that redefines how information is integrated, data is analysed, and decisions are made across every aspect of business operations. Unlike previous technological waves that primarily affected specific industries or functions, AI's impact cuts across all sectors simultaneously.</p> \n \n<p>The democratisation happens through cloud computing platforms that package complex AI capabilities into user-friendly interfaces. A small retailer can now access the same customer behaviour prediction algorithms that power major e-commerce platforms. A local manufacturer can implement quality control systems that rival those of industrial giants. The barriers to entry—massive computing infrastructure, teams of data scientists, years of algorithm development—have largely evaporated.</p> \n \n<p>Consider the transformation in customer relationship management. Where large corporations once held decisive advantages through expensive CRM systems and dedicated analytics teams, small businesses can now deploy AI-powered tools that automatically segment customers, predict purchasing behaviour, and personalise marketing messages. The playing field appears more level than ever before.</p> \n \n<p>Yet this apparent equalisation masks deeper complexities. Access to tools doesn't automatically translate to competitive advantage, and the same AI systems that empower small businesses also amplify the capabilities of their larger competitors. The question isn't whether AI will reshape local economies—it already is. The question is whether this reshaping will favour David or Goliath.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Local Economies in Flux \n</h2> \n \n<p>Much like the corner shop discovering it can compete with retail giants through predictive analytics, local economies are experiencing transformations that challenge traditional assumptions about scale and proximity. The impact unfolds in unexpected ways. Traditional advantages—proximity to customers, personal relationships, intimate market knowledge—suddenly matter less when AI can predict consumer behaviour with precision. Simultaneously, new advantages emerge for businesses that can harness these tools effectively.</p> \n \n<p>Small businesses often possess inherent agility that larger corporations struggle to match. They can implement new AI systems faster, pivot strategies more quickly, and adapt to local market conditions with greater flexibility. A family-owned restaurant can adjust its menu based on AI-analysed customer preferences within days, while a chain restaurant might need months to implement similar changes across its corporate structure.</p> \n \n<p>The \"tele-everything\" environment accelerated by AI adoption fundamentally alters the value of physical presence. Local businesses that once relied primarily on foot traffic and geographical convenience must now compete with online-first enterprises that leverage AI to deliver personalised experiences regardless of location. This shift doesn't necessarily disadvantage local businesses, but it forces them to compete on new terms.</p> \n \n<p>Some local economies are experiencing a renaissance as AI enables small businesses to serve global markets. A craftsperson in rural Wales can now use AI-powered tools to identify international customers, optimise pricing strategies, and manage complex supply chains that were previously beyond their capabilities. The local becomes global, but the global also becomes intensely local as AI enables mass customisation and hyper-personalised services.</p> \n \n<p>The transformation extends beyond individual businesses to entire economic ecosystems. Local suppliers, service providers, and complementary businesses must all adapt to new AI-driven demands and capabilities. A local accounting firm might find its traditional bookkeeping services automated away, but discover new opportunities in helping businesses implement and optimise AI systems. The ripple effects create new interdependencies and collaborative possibilities that reshape entire commercial districts.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The Corporate Response \n</h2> \n \n<p>Large corporations aren't passive observers in this transformation. They're simultaneously benefiting from the same AI democratisation while developing strategies to maintain their competitive advantages. The result is an arms race where both small businesses and corporations are rapidly adopting AI capabilities, but with vastly different resources and strategic approaches.</p> \n \n<p>Corporate advantages in the AI era often centre on data volume and variety. While small businesses can access sophisticated AI tools, large corporations possess vast datasets that can train more accurate and powerful models. A multinational retailer has purchase data from millions of customers across diverse markets, enabling AI insights that a local shop with hundreds of customers simply cannot match. This data advantage compounds over time, as larger datasets enable more sophisticated AI models, which generate better insights, which attract more customers, which generate more data.</p> \n \n<p>Scale also provides advantages in AI implementation. Corporations can afford dedicated AI teams, custom algorithm development, and integration across multiple business functions. They can experiment with cutting-edge technologies, absorb the costs of failed implementations, and iterate rapidly towards optimal solutions. Small businesses, despite having access to AI tools, often lack the resources for such comprehensive adoption.</p> \n \n<p>However, corporate size can also become a liability. Large organisations often struggle with legacy systems, bureaucratic decision-making processes, and resistance to change. A small business can implement a new AI-powered inventory management system in weeks, while a corporation might need years to navigate internal approvals, system integrations, and change management processes. The very complexity that enables corporate scale can inhibit the rapid adaptation that AI environments reward.</p> \n \n<p>The competitive dynamics become particularly complex in markets where corporations and small businesses serve similar customer needs. AI enables both to offer increasingly sophisticated services, but the nature of competition shifts from traditional factors like price and convenience to new dimensions like personalisation depth, prediction accuracy, and automated service quality. A local financial advisor equipped with AI-powered portfolio analysis tools might compete effectively with major investment firms, not on the breadth of services, but on the depth of personal attention combined with sophisticated analytical capabilities.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  New Forms of Inequality \n</h2> \n \n<p>The promise of AI democratisation comes with a darker counterpart: the emergence of new forms of inequality that may prove more entrenched than those they replace. While AI tools become more accessible, the skills, knowledge, and resources required to use them effectively remain unevenly distributed.</p> \n \n<p>Digital literacy emerges as a critical factor determining who benefits from AI democratisation. Small business owners who can understand and implement AI systems gain significant advantages over those who cannot. This creates a new divide not based on access to capital or technology, but on the ability to comprehend and leverage complex digital tools. The gap between AI-savvy and AI-naive businesses may prove wider than traditional competitive gaps.</p> \n \n<p>A significant portion of technology experts express concern about AI's societal impact. Research from the Pew Research Centre indicates that many experts believe the tech-driven future will worsen life for most people, specifically citing \"greater inequality\" as a major outcome. This pessimism stems partly from AI's potential to replace human workers while concentrating benefits among those who own and control AI systems.</p> \n \n<p>The productivity gains from AI create a paradox for small businesses. While these tools can dramatically increase efficiency and capability, they also reduce the need for human employees. A small business that once employed ten people might accomplish the same work with five people and sophisticated AI systems. The business becomes more competitive, but contributes less to local employment and economic circulation. This labour-saving potential of AI creates a fundamental tension between business efficiency and community economic health.</p> \n \n<p>Geographic inequality also intensifies as AI adoption varies significantly across regions. Areas with strong digital infrastructure, educated populations, and supportive business environments see rapid AI adoption among local businesses. Rural or economically disadvantaged areas lag behind, creating growing gaps in local economic competitiveness. The digital divide evolves into an AI divide with potentially more severe consequences.</p> \n \n<p>Access to data becomes another source of inequality. While AI tools are democratised, the data required to train them effectively often isn't. Businesses in data-rich environments—urban areas with dense customer interactions, regions with strong digital adoption, markets with sophisticated tracking systems—can leverage AI more effectively than those in data-poor environments. This creates a new form of resource inequality where information, rather than capital or labour, becomes the primary determinant of competitive advantage.</p> \n \n<p>The emergence of these inequalities is particularly concerning because they compound existing disadvantages. Businesses that already struggle with traditional competitive factors—limited capital, poor locations, outdated infrastructure—often find themselves least equipped to navigate AI adoption successfully. The democratisation of AI tools doesn't automatically democratise the benefits if the underlying capabilities to use them remain concentrated.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The Skills Revolution \n</h2> \n \n<p>The AI transformation demands new skills that don't align neatly with traditional business education or experience. Small business owners must become part technologist, part data analyst, part strategic planner in ways that previous generations never required. This skills revolution creates opportunities for some while leaving others behind.</p> \n \n<p>Traditional business skills—relationship building, local market knowledge, operational efficiency—remain important but are no longer sufficient. Success increasingly requires understanding how to select appropriate AI tools, interpret outputs, and integrate digital systems with human processes. The learning curve is steep, and not everyone can climb it effectively. A successful restaurant owner with decades of experience in food service and customer relations might struggle to understand machine learning concepts or data analytics principles necessary to leverage AI-powered inventory management or customer prediction systems.</p> \n \n<p>Educational institutions struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving skill requirements. Business schools that taught traditional management principles find themselves scrambling to incorporate AI literacy into curricula. Vocational training programmes designed for traditional trades must now include digital components. The mismatch between educational offerings and business needs creates gaps that some entrepreneurs can bridge while others cannot.</p> \n \n<p>Generational differences compound the skills challenge. Younger business owners who grew up with digital technology often adapt more quickly to AI tools, while older entrepreneurs with decades of experience may find the transition more difficult. This creates potential for generational turnover in local business leadership as AI adoption becomes essential for competitiveness. However, the relationship isn't simply age-based—some older business owners embrace AI enthusiastically while some younger ones struggle with its complexity.</p> \n \n<p>The skills revolution also affects employees within small businesses. Workers must adapt to AI-augmented roles, learning to collaborate with systems rather than simply performing traditional tasks. Some thrive in this environment, developing hybrid human-AI capabilities that make them more valuable. Others struggle with the transition, potentially facing displacement or reduced relevance. A retail employee who learns to work with AI-powered inventory systems and customer analytics becomes more valuable, while one who resists such integration may find their role diminished.</p> \n \n<p>The pace of change in required skills creates ongoing challenges. AI capabilities evolve rapidly, meaning that skills learned today may become obsolete within years. This demands a culture of continuous learning that many small businesses struggle to maintain while managing day-to-day operations. The businesses that succeed are often those that can balance immediate operational needs with ongoing skill development.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Redefining Competition \n</h2> \n \n<p>Just as the local restaurant now competes on supply chain optimisation rather than just food quality, AI doesn't just change the tools of competition; it fundamentally alters what businesses compete on. Traditional competitive factors like price, location, and product quality remain important, but new dimensions emerge that can overwhelm traditional advantages.</p> \n \n<p>Prediction capability becomes a key competitive differentiator. Businesses that can accurately forecast customer needs, market trends, and operational requirements gain significant advantages over those relying on intuition or historical patterns. A local retailer that predicts seasonal demand fluctuations can optimise inventory and pricing in ways that traditional competitors cannot match. This predictive capability extends beyond simple forecasting to understanding complex patterns in customer behaviour, market dynamics, and operational efficiency.</p> \n \n<p>Personalisation depth emerges as another competitive battlefield. AI enables small businesses to offer individually customised experiences that were previously impossible at their scale. A neighbourhood coffee shop can remember every customer's preferences, predict their likely orders, and adjust recommendations based on weather, time of day, and purchasing history. This level of personalisation can compete effectively with larger chains that offer consistency but less individual attention.</p> \n \n<p>Speed of adaptation becomes crucial as market conditions change rapidly. Businesses that can quickly adjust strategies, modify offerings, and respond to new opportunities gain advantages over slower competitors. AI systems that continuously monitor market conditions and automatically adjust business parameters enable small businesses to be more responsive than larger organisations with complex decision-making hierarchies. A small online retailer can adjust pricing in real-time based on competitor analysis and demand patterns, while a large corporation might need weeks to implement similar changes.</p> \n \n<p>Data quality and integration emerge as competitive moats. Businesses that collect clean, comprehensive data and integrate it effectively across all operations can leverage AI more powerfully than those with fragmented or poor-quality information. This creates incentives for better data management practices but also advantages businesses that start with superior data collection capabilities. A small business that systematically tracks customer interactions, inventory movements, and operational metrics can build AI capabilities that larger competitors with poor data practices cannot match.</p> \n \n<p>The redefinition of competition extends to entire business models. AI enables new forms of value creation that weren't previously possible at small business scale. A local service provider might develop AI-powered tools that become valuable products in their own right. A neighbourhood retailer might create data insights that benefit other local businesses. Competition evolves from zero-sum battles over market share to more complex ecosystems of value creation and exchange.</p> \n \n<p>Customer expectations also shift as AI capabilities become more common. Businesses that don't offer AI-enabled features—personalised recommendations, predictive service, automated support—may appear outdated compared to competitors that do. This creates pressure for AI adoption not just for operational efficiency, but for customer satisfaction and retention.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The Network Effect \n</h2> \n \n<p>As AI adoption spreads across local economies, network effects emerge that can either amplify competitive advantages or create new forms of exclusion. Businesses that adopt AI early and effectively often find their advantages compound over time, while those that lag behind face increasingly difficult catch-up challenges.</p> \n \n<p>Data network effects prove particularly powerful. Businesses that collect more customer data can train better AI models, which provide superior service, which attracts more customers, which generates more data. This virtuous cycle can quickly separate AI-successful businesses from their competitors in ways that traditional competitive dynamics rarely achieved. A local delivery service that uses AI to optimise routes and predict demand can provide faster, more reliable service, attracting more customers and generating more data to further improve its AI systems.</p> \n \n<p>Partnership networks also evolve around AI capabilities. Small businesses that can effectively integrate AI systems often find new collaboration opportunities with other AI-enabled enterprises. They can share data insights, coordinate supply chains, and develop joint offerings that leverage combined AI capabilities. Businesses that cannot participate in these AI-enabled networks risk isolation from emerging collaborative opportunities.</p> \n \n<p>Platform effects emerge as AI tools become more sophisticated and interconnected. Businesses that adopt compatible AI systems can more easily integrate with suppliers, customers, and partners who use similar technologies. This creates pressure for standardisation around particular AI platforms, potentially disadvantaging businesses that choose different or incompatible systems. A small manufacturer that uses AI systems compatible with its suppliers' inventory management can achieve seamless coordination, while one using incompatible systems faces integration challenges.</p> \n \n<p>The network effects extend beyond individual businesses to entire local economic ecosystems. Regions where many businesses adopt AI capabilities can develop supportive infrastructure, shared expertise, and collaborative advantages that attract additional AI-enabled enterprises. Areas that lag in AI adoption may find themselves increasingly isolated from broader economic networks. Cities that develop strong AI business clusters can offer shared resources, talent pools, and collaborative opportunities that individual businesses in less developed areas cannot access.</p> \n \n<p>Knowledge networks become particularly important as AI implementation requires ongoing learning and adaptation. Businesses in areas with strong AI adoption can share experiences, learn from each other's successes and failures, and collectively develop expertise that benefits the entire local economy. This creates positive feedback loops where AI success breeds more AI success, but also means that areas that fall behind may find it increasingly difficult to catch up.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Global Reach, Local Impact \n</h2> \n \n<p>AI democratisation enables small businesses to compete in global markets while simultaneously making global competition more intense at the local level. This paradox creates both opportunities and threats for local economies in ways that previous technological waves didn't achieve.</p> \n \n<p>A small manufacturer in Manchester can now use AI to identify customers in markets they never previously accessed, optimise international shipping routes, and manage currency fluctuations with sophisticated algorithms. The barriers to global commerce—language translation, market research, logistics coordination—diminish significantly when AI tools handle these complexities automatically. Machine learning systems can analyse global market trends, identify emerging opportunities, and even handle customer service in multiple languages, enabling small businesses to operate internationally with capabilities that previously required large multinational operations.</p> \n \n<p>However, this global reach works in both directions. Local businesses that once competed primarily with nearby enterprises now face competition from AI-enabled businesses anywhere in the world. A local graphic design firm competes not just with other local designers, but with AI-augmented freelancers from dozens of countries who can deliver similar services at potentially lower costs. The protective barriers of geography and local relationships diminish when AI enables remote competitors to offer personalised, efficient service regardless of physical location.</p> \n \n<p>The globalisation of competition through AI creates pressure for local businesses to find defensible advantages that global competitors cannot easily replicate. Physical presence, local relationships, and regulatory compliance become more valuable when other competitive factors can be matched by distant AI-enabled competitors. A local accountant might compete with global AI-powered tax preparation services by offering face-to-face consultation and deep knowledge of local regulations that remote competitors cannot match.</p> \n \n<p>Cultural and regulatory differences provide some protection for local businesses, but AI's ability to adapt to local preferences and navigate regulatory requirements reduces these natural barriers. A global e-commerce platform can use AI to automatically adjust its offerings for local tastes, comply with regional regulations, and even communicate in local dialects or cultural contexts. This erosion of natural competitive barriers forces local businesses to compete more directly on service quality, innovation, and efficiency rather than relying on geographic or cultural advantages.</p> \n \n<p>The global competition enabled by AI also creates opportunities for specialisation and niche market development. Small businesses can use AI to identify and serve highly specific customer segments globally, rather than trying to serve broad local markets. A craftsperson specialising in traditional techniques can use AI to find customers worldwide who value their specific skills, creating sustainable businesses around expertise that might not support a local market.</p> \n \n<p>International collaboration becomes more feasible as AI tools handle communication, coordination, and logistics challenges. Small businesses can participate in global supply chains, joint ventures, and collaborative projects that were previously accessible only to large corporations. This creates opportunities for local businesses to access global resources, expertise, and markets while maintaining their local identity and operations.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Policy and Regulatory Responses \n</h2> \n \n<p>Governments and regulatory bodies are beginning to recognise the transformative potential of AI democratisation and its implications for local economies. Policy responses vary significantly across jurisdictions, creating a patchwork of approaches that may determine which regions benefit most from AI-enabled economic transformation.</p> \n \n<p>Some governments focus on ensuring broad access to AI tools and training, recognising that digital divides could become AI divides with severe economic consequences. Public funding for AI education, infrastructure development, and small business support programmes aims to prevent the emergence of AI-enabled inequality between different economic actors and regions. The European Union's Digital Single Market strategy includes provisions for supporting small business AI adoption, while countries like Singapore have developed comprehensive AI governance frameworks that include support for small and medium enterprises.</p> \n \n<p>Competition policy faces new challenges as AI blurs traditional boundaries between markets and competitive advantages. Regulators must determine whether AI democratisation genuinely increases competition or whether it creates new forms of market concentration that require intervention. The complexity of AI systems makes it difficult to assess competitive impacts using traditional regulatory frameworks. When a few large technology companies provide the AI platforms that most small businesses depend on, questions arise about whether this creates new forms of economic dependency that require regulatory attention.</p> \n \n<p>Data governance emerges as a critical policy area affecting small business competitiveness. Regulations that restrict data collection or sharing may inadvertently disadvantage small businesses that rely on AI tools requiring substantial data inputs. Conversely, policies that enable broader data access might help level the playing field between small businesses and large corporations with extensive proprietary datasets. The General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, for example, affects how small businesses can collect and use customer data for AI applications, potentially limiting their ability to compete with larger companies that have more resources for compliance.</p> \n \n<p>Privacy and security regulations create compliance burdens that affect small businesses differently than large corporations. While AI tools can help automate compliance processes, the underlying regulatory requirements may still favour businesses with dedicated legal and technical resources. Policy makers must balance privacy protection with the need to avoid creating insurmountable barriers for small business AI adoption.</p> \n \n<p>International coordination becomes increasingly important as AI-enabled businesses operate across borders more easily. Differences in AI regulation, data governance, and digital trade policies between countries can create competitive advantages or disadvantages for businesses in different jurisdictions. Small businesses with limited resources to navigate complex international regulatory environments may find themselves at a disadvantage compared to larger enterprises with dedicated compliance teams.</p> \n \n<p>The pace of AI development often outstrips regulatory responses, creating uncertainty for businesses trying to plan AI investments and implementations. Regulatory frameworks developed for traditional business models may not adequately address the unique challenges and opportunities created by AI adoption. This regulatory lag can create both opportunities for early adopters and risks for businesses that invest in AI capabilities that later face regulatory restrictions.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  The Human Element \n</h2> \n \n<p>Despite AI's growing capabilities, human factors remain crucial in determining which businesses succeed in the AI-enabled economy. The interaction between human creativity, judgement, and relationship-building skills with AI capabilities often determines competitive outcomes more than pure technological sophistication.</p> \n \n<p>Small businesses often possess advantages in human-AI collaboration that larger organisations struggle to match. The close relationships between owners, employees, and customers in small businesses enable more nuanced understanding of how AI tools should be deployed and customised. A local business owner who knows their customers personally can guide AI systems more effectively than distant corporate algorithms. This intimate knowledge allows for AI implementations that enhance rather than replace human insights and relationships.</p> \n \n<p>Trust and relationships become more valuable, not less, as AI capabilities proliferate. Customers who feel overwhelmed by purely digital interactions may gravitate towards businesses that combine AI efficiency with human warmth and understanding. Small businesses that successfully blend AI capabilities with personal service can differentiate themselves from purely digital competitors. A local bank that uses AI for fraud detection and risk assessment while maintaining personal relationships with customers can offer security and efficiency alongside human understanding and flexibility.</p> \n \n<p>The human element also affects AI implementation success within businesses. Small business owners who can effectively communicate AI benefits to employees, customers, and partners are more likely to achieve successful adoption than those who treat AI as a purely technical implementation. Change management skills become as important as technical capabilities in determining AI success. Employees who understand how AI tools enhance their work rather than threaten their jobs are more likely to use these tools effectively and contribute to successful implementation.</p> \n \n<p>Ethical considerations around AI use create opportunities for small businesses to differentiate themselves through more responsible AI deployment. While large corporations may face pressure to maximise AI efficiency regardless of broader impacts, small businesses with strong community ties may choose AI implementations that prioritise local employment, customer privacy, or social benefit alongside business objectives. This ethical positioning can become a competitive advantage in markets where customers value responsible business practices.</p> \n \n<p>The human element extends to customer experience design and service delivery. AI can handle routine tasks and provide data insights, but human creativity and empathy remain essential for understanding customer needs, designing meaningful experiences, and building lasting relationships. Small businesses that use AI to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them often achieve better customer satisfaction and loyalty than those that pursue purely automated solutions.</p> \n \n<p>Creativity and innovation in AI application often come from human insights about customer needs, market opportunities, and operational challenges. Small business owners who understand their operations intimately can identify AI applications that larger competitors might miss. This human insight into business operations and customer needs becomes a source of competitive advantage in AI implementation.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Future Trajectories \n</h2> \n \n<p>The trajectory of AI democratisation and its impact on local economies remains uncertain, with multiple possible futures depending on technological development, policy choices, and market dynamics. Understanding these potential paths helps businesses and policymakers prepare for different scenarios.</p> \n \n<p>One trajectory leads towards genuine democratisation where AI tools become so accessible and easy to use that most small businesses can compete effectively with larger enterprises on AI-enabled capabilities. In this scenario, local economies flourish as small businesses leverage AI to serve global markets while maintaining local roots and relationships. The corner shop truly does compete with Amazon, not by matching its scale, but by offering superior personalisation and local relevance powered by AI insights.</p> \n \n<p>An alternative trajectory sees AI democratisation creating new forms of concentration where a few AI platform providers control the tools that all businesses depend on. Small businesses gain access to AI capabilities but become dependent on platforms controlled by large technology companies, potentially creating new forms of economic subjugation rather than liberation. In this scenario, the democratisation of AI tools masks a concentration of control over the underlying infrastructure and algorithms that determine business success.</p> \n \n<p>A third possibility involves fragmentation where AI adoption varies dramatically across regions, industries, and business types, creating a complex patchwork of AI-enabled and traditional businesses. This scenario might preserve diversity in business models and competitive approaches but could also create significant inequalities between different economic actors and regions. Some areas become AI-powered economic hubs while others remain trapped in traditional competitive dynamics.</p> \n \n<p>The speed of AI development affects all these trajectories. Rapid advancement might favour businesses and regions that can adapt quickly while leaving others behind. Slower, more gradual development might enable broader adoption and more equitable outcomes but could also delay beneficial transformations in productivity and capability. The current pace of AI development, particularly in generative AI capabilities, suggests that rapid change is more likely than gradual evolution.</p> \n \n<p>International competition adds another dimension to these trajectories. Countries that develop strong AI capabilities and supportive regulatory frameworks may see their local businesses gain advantages over those in less developed AI ecosystems. China's rapid advancement in AI innovation, as documented by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, demonstrates how national AI strategies can affect local business competitiveness on a global scale.</p> \n \n<p>The role of human-AI collaboration will likely determine which trajectory emerges. Research from the Pew Research Centre suggests that the most positive outcomes occur when AI enhances human capabilities rather than simply replacing them. Local economies that successfully integrate AI tools with human skills and relationships may achieve better outcomes than those that pursue purely technological solutions.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Preparing for Transformation \n</h2> \n \n<p>The AI transformation of local economies is not a distant future possibility but a current reality that businesses, policymakers, and communities must navigate actively. Success in this environment requires understanding both the opportunities and risks while developing strategies that leverage AI capabilities while preserving human and community values.</p> \n \n<p>Small businesses must develop AI literacy not as a technical specialisation but as a core business capability. This means understanding what AI can and cannot do, how to select appropriate tools, and how to integrate AI systems with existing operations and relationships. The learning curve is steep, but the costs of falling behind may be steeper. Business owners need to invest time in understanding AI capabilities, experimenting with available tools, and developing strategies for gradual implementation that builds on their existing strengths.</p> \n \n<p>Local communities and policymakers must consider how to support AI adoption while preserving the diversity and character that make local economies valuable. This might involve public investment in digital infrastructure, education programmes, or support for businesses struggling with AI transition. The goal should be enabling beneficial transformation rather than simply accelerating technological adoption. Communities that proactively address AI adoption challenges are more likely to benefit from the opportunities while mitigating the risks.</p> \n \n<p>The democratisation of AI represents both the greatest opportunity and the greatest challenge facing local economies in generations. It promises to level competitive playing fields that have favoured large corporations for decades while threatening to create new forms of inequality that could be more entrenched than those they replace. The outcome will depend not on the technology itself, but on how wisely we deploy it in service of human and community flourishing.</p> \n \n<p>Collaboration between businesses, educational institutions, and government agencies becomes essential for successful AI adoption. Small businesses need access to training, technical support, and financial resources to implement AI effectively. Educational institutions must adapt curricula to include AI literacy alongside traditional business skills. Government agencies must develop policies that support beneficial AI adoption while preventing harmful concentration of power or exclusion of vulnerable businesses.</p> \n \n<p>The transformation requires balancing efficiency gains with social and economic values. While AI can dramatically improve business productivity and competitiveness, communities must consider the broader impacts on employment, social cohesion, and economic diversity. The most successful AI adoptions are likely to be those that enhance human capabilities and community strengths rather than simply replacing them with automated systems.</p> \n \n<p>As we stand at this inflection point, the choices made by individual businesses, local communities, and policymakers will determine whether AI democratisation fulfils its promise of economic empowerment or becomes another force for concentration and inequality. The technology provides the tools; wisdom in their application will determine the results.</p> \n \n<p>The corner shop that predicts your needs, the restaurant that optimises its operations, the consultancy that analyses like a giant—these are no longer future possibilities but present realities. The question is no longer whether AI will transform local economies, but whether that transformation will create the more equitable and prosperous future that its democratisation promises. The answer lies not in the algorithms themselves, but in the human choices that guide their deployment.</p> \n \n<p>Is AI levelling the field, or just redrawing the battle lines?</p> \n \n \n \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  References and Further Information \n</h2> \n \n<p><strong>Primary Sources:</strong></p> \n \n<p>Brookings Institution. \"How artificial intelligence is transforming the world.\" Available at: <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu\">www.brookings.edu</a></p> \n \n<p>Pew Research Center. \"Experts Say the 'New Normal' in 2025 Will Be Far More Tech-Driven.\" Available at: <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org\">www.pewresearch.org</a></p> \n \n<p>Pew Research Center. \"Improvements ahead: How humans and AI might evolve together in the next decade.\" Available at: <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org\">www.pewresearch.org</a></p> \n \n<p>ScienceDirect. \"Opinion Paper: 'So what if ChatGPT wrote it?'

OpenAI and its popular generative pre-trained models offer many benefits, but there are also some potential drawbacks to consider.</p> \n \n<p>Regardless, OpenAI and it’s popular Large Language Model (LLM) ChatGPT are cutting-edge technologies that will revolutionize the language translation industry.</p> \n \n<p>In fact, it’s happening as you read this article.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Background and what you’ll learn \n</h2> \n \n<p>As language industry veterans and software developers, we have first-hand experience in harnessing artificial intelligence for natural language processing. In fact, it’s our mission at Pairaphrase to make translation fast, smart and safe for multinational enterprise organizations.</p> \n \n<p>While Machine Translation has been around since the 80’s, the growing popularity of AI-powered translation services is now amplified with the buzz surrounding ChatGPT and Agentic Translation solutions. OpenAI's advanced language model offers powerful translation capabilities and productivity gains.</p> \n \n<p>However, there are pros and cons to using OpenAI for language translation. Oftentimes, the pros and cons depend on the content you intend to translate with OpenAI.</p> \n \n<p>Familiarize yourself with the following advantages and disadvantages of translating with ChatGPT/OpenAI. As a result, you can make an informed decision for your organization.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Pros of Using OpenAI for Language Translation \n</h2> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Accuracy \n</h3> \n \n<p>While there have been some concerns about accuracy and hallucinations, OpenAI's language model will oftentimes produce accurate translations. This is due to its extensive training on vast amounts of pre-existing data.</p> \n \n<p>More time is needed to understand how accurate OpenAI translation is.</p> \n \n<p>There are multiple benefits to using a highly accurate translation tool to translate text. These include:</p> \n \n<p>Decent first-draft translation</p> \n \n<p>Lack of misspellings</p> \n \n<p>Less edits required</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Broad Language Support \n</h3> \n \n<p>If your organization needs to translate a wide range of languages and language pairs, it’s possible with OpenAI. It supports almost any language pair your organization requires for commercial use.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Speed &amp; Efficiency \n</h3> \n \n<p>Its fast production of translations (compared to pure human translation) makes OpenAI suitable for real-time translation needs or situations that require high-volume translation.</p> \n \n<p>You can integrate the OpenAI API into your organization’s other software applications such as <a href=\"https://www.pairaphrase.com/blog/translation-management-systems\">Translation Management Systems</a> (TMS) and Content Management Systems (CMS). All you need is the API key.</p> \n \n<p>Alternatively, you can use translation software that comes with ChatGPT built into the application.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Contextual Understanding \n</h3> \n \n<p>Want to produce coherent and contextually accurate translations? This is possible due to OpenAI's ability to comprehend and interpret the context of the text being translated.</p> \n \n<p>While this is true in many instances, it’s important to read the “cons” list in this article to grasp the nuances of this.</p> \n \n<p>OpenAI uses large language models (LLMs). This language model makes predictions based on the large amounts of data on which it’s been pre-trained. Compare this with Natural Language Processing (NLP) which uses the immediate context of your text to generate a translation.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Continuous Improvement \n</h3> \n \n<p>OpenAI's language models are continuously updated and refined, ensuring that translation quality can improve over time as the model learns from new data. Continuous improvement means your organization will need to spend less hours translating as time moves forward.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Ideal for Consumer-Facing Content \n</h3> \n \n<p>When you use OpenAI for language translation, you can expect it to be less “dry” than word-for-word translation. This makes it great for consumer-facing text and entertainment content. In other words, it’s ideal for transcreation.</p> \n \n<p>Whether you’re translating fictional literature, video scripts or advertising copy, OpenAI is a good option.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Cons of Using OpenAI for Language Translation \n</h2> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  OpenAI May Not Be Ideal for Technical Translation \n</h3> \n \n<p>Need to develop translations for technical concepts or straight-forward texts? Don’t use OpenAI for that. Based on our professional experience with various machine translation engines, we recommend Google and Microsoft’s engines for those types of translation projects.</p> \n \n<p>Google and Microsoft stick to word-for-word translations as per traditional translation methodology. It shouldn’t be treated as a replacement for traditional translation methodology.</p> \n \n<p>OpenAI is a complementary Machine Translation option, as it’s more suited for consumer-facing texts, as mentioned in the “pros” list above.</p> \n \n<p>Tip: Familiarize yourself with the best translation engine to use by content type.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Non-English Translations Might Suffer \n</h3> \n \n<p>If you have a lot of content with the source language as English, OpenAI will likely generate better translations for you. This is because it’s pre-trained on mostly English due to the existence of more English language content on the internet.</p> \n \n<p>Compare this to foreign language content, of which there is naturally less abundance online. This is because there’s less volume of published content in those languages.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Limited Subject Matter Expertise \n</h3> \n \n<p>While it’s trained on large datasets, be cautious when using OpenAI for translation of specialized knowledge. It will likely present knowledge gaps in your texts.</p> \n \n<p>This applies for non-technical texts, too. For example, if you were to transcreate a science fiction novel, this would involve translating scientific concepts–albeit fictional. This means even a literary translation of a fictional technical concept could be negatively affected by relying on artificial intelligence alone.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Trouble with Ambiguous Text \n</h3> \n \n<p>Pay careful attention to this one if your source text includes ambiguous text made complex by cultural references, nuances or idiomatic expressions or nuances. This applies to machine translation in general (not only when you translate using OpenAI).</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Potential for Bias &amp; Inaccurate Data \n</h3> \n \n<p>When you translate using OpenAI, it’s important to note that its translation quality relies on the quality of the data that was used to train it. Biased or inaccurate training data may affect the accuracy and reliability of OpenAI's translations.</p> \n \n<p>This is a well-known weakness of OpenAI, and it applies for more use cases than just translation.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Security &amp; Privacy Concerns \n</h3> \n \n<p>When you use OpenAI/ChatGPT, it warns you not to enter confidential information into the chatbot.</p> \n \n<p>If you’re going to translate sensitive or confidential information, make sure you use OpenAI via a translation management system that doesn’t return data to machine translation engines. This means your data won’t be sent back to OpenAI.</p> \n \n<p>Try Pairaphrase for secure ChatGPT translations.</p> \n \n<h3> \n   \n   \n  Can't Translate a Scanned PDF Document \n</h3> \n \n<p>ChatGPT itself cannot translate a scanned document on its own without help from external tools. It doesn't have the capability to extract the text from the scanned document for translation.</p> \n \n<p>However, you can accomplish this with an AI PDF translator such as Pairaphrase.</p> \n \n<p>It is translation software integrated with ChatGPT AND it includes optical character recognition (OCR). This means you can extract the text using OCR and translate your scanned document, all without leaving the Pairaphrase application.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Key Takeaway \n</h2> \n \n<p>AI-assisted translation can completely transform your organization’s productivity.</p> \n \n<p>However, it’s important to always use human oversight when using AI. If you decide to use OpenAI/ChatGPT for translation, make sure you fully understand your organization’s policies on data security and quality assurance.</p> \n \n<p>And remember, you might be better off using other translation engines for technical translations.</p> \n \n<p>Dive Deeper: Explore the 17 best AI translators for enterprise teams</p> \n \n<p>Now that you understand OpenAI's translation strengths and weaknesses, we'll recommend a solution below that gives you the best of both LLM translation and non-LLM translation in a secure environment.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  Conclusion: \n</h2> \n \n<p>OpenAI’s translation capabilities offer impressive speed, adaptability and creativity, making them a strong option for organizations seeking to enhance productivity and improve consumer-facing content. However, these benefits come with important considerations—ranging from accuracy limitations in technical domains to privacy concerns and variability in non-English performance. With the right safeguards, human oversight, and a clear understanding of when OpenAI is (and isn’t) the best tool for the job, organizations can harness AI translation effectively. Ultimately, the strongest approach pairs LLM-powered innovation with traditional machine translation and secure translation workflows to achieve the best balance of quality, reliability and data protection.</p> \n \n<p><em>This content was originally published <a href=\"https://www.pairaphrase.com/blog/openai-language-translation\">here</a></em></p>"

At its core, an LLM understands a fixed set of words called a <strong>vocabulary</strong> and assigns probabilities to each word appearing in a given context. </p>  \n  \n<p>The \"Large\" in LLM refers to the <strong>number of parameters</strong> the model contains. These models can have billions or even trillions of parameters, allowing them to capture complex patterns in language. While there's no universally agreed-upon threshold for what constitutes \"large,\" modern LLMs typically range from hundreds of millions to hundreds of billions of parameters.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Understanding Vocabulary Size  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Recent research has revealed that vocabulary size plays a crucial role in LLM performance, with optimal vocabulary sizes depending on the compute budget used for training. Most modern LLMs use vocabulary sizes ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 tokens, though this varies significantly:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  \n<strong>BERT</strong>: 30,000 tokens (WordPiece tokenization)</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>GPT-3</strong>: ~50,000 tokens</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Llama 2</strong>: 32,000 tokens</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>RoBERTa</strong>: 50,265 tokens (Byte-Pair Encoding)</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>T5</strong>: 32,128 tokens</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Research suggests that many existing LLMs actually use suboptimal vocabulary sizes - for example, Llama2-70B's optimal vocabulary size should have been at least 216,000 tokens, seven times larger than its actual 32,000-token vocabulary.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  LLM Architectures: The Three Main Types  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Modern transformer models use one of three fundamental architectures: encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder-decoder (sequence-to-sequence). Each architecture is optimized for different types of tasks.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  1. Encoder-Only Models  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Encoders are designed to convert sequences of words into vector representations (embeddings) that can be used for various predictive modeling tasks such as classification. These models use <strong>bidirectional attention</strong>, meaning they can look at context from both directions simultaneously.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Use bidirectional attention to access all words in the input sentence</li>  \n<li>Specialized in understanding and analyzing text</li>  \n<li>Pretrained using masked language modeling objectives</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p><strong>Popular Encoder Models:</strong></p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li><p><strong>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</strong>: Introduced in October 2018 by Google researchers, BERT uses 12-24 layers (depending on the variant) and dramatically improved the state of the art for many NLP tasks.

The data plane is written in Rust and can be configured via xDS (a gRPC-based protocol) and YAML. Recently they decided to replace kgateway’s AI data plane from Envoy to agentgateway. I expect the enterprise version of Gloo will follow. Previously, most AI-related data-plane features were implemented in Envoy calling a Go sidecar via ext_proc, and I guess the real-world results were mediocre.</p>  \n  \n<p>This gateway supports four AI scenarios:</p>  \n  \n<ol>  \n<li>MCP  \n</li>  \n<li>A2A  \n</li>  \n<li>Proxying inference requests to LLM providers  \n</li>  \n<li>Load balancing for inference services</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<p>Below I explain each of these scenarios. Note I’m discussing the open-source agentgateway — some features may exist only in the enterprise edition and are outside the scope of this doc.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  MCP  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>agentgateway was originally started to address the difficulty of handling stateful MCP requests in existing Envoy data planes. So its MCP support is the most complete.</p>  \n  \n<p>By default, agentgateway treats MCP as a stateful protocol. It has a SessionManager struct responsible for session creation and maintenance (<a href=\"https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/blob/1ca00e32d3f475539a20120f72c45c05aaf80377/crates/agentgateway/src/mcp/session.rs#L370\">code link</a>). But this SessionManager is a local in-process store, which means if you run multiple agentgateway instances there’s no guarantee a client will hit the same SessionManager each time. If you want sticky sessions toward upstreams, it’s actually simpler to consistent-hash on the MCP-Session-ID header so the same session ID routes to the same backend even if requests land on different agentgateway instances. Extending SessionManager to use a remote store is another solution, but it’s more expensive. To me, making MCP stateful by default is a mistake. I’m glad they plan to make MCP a <a href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1442\">default stateless protocol</a>.</p>  \n  \n<p>When there is more than one backend, agentgateway enables MCP multiplexing. For example, with tools: when listing tools, agentgateway sends tools/list to every backend, then rewrites tool names to the format <code>${backend_name}_${tool_name}</code>. When a tool call comes in, agentgateway routes to the actual backend. For methods that can’t be multiplexed, it returns an invalid method error.</p>  \n  \n<p>Besides forwarding to MCP backends, agentgateway supports converting RESTful APIs to MCP tools using an OpenAPI spec. Impressively, it supports using an entire spec as a backend and includes a fair amount of schema-parsing code. agentgateway positions itself here as an MCP-to-RESTful-API forwarder; it does not itself manage the RESTful APIs described in the OpenAPI spec. Some details are still missing — for example, bodies only support application/json, HTTPS upstreams aren’t supported yet, structured output is not yet supported, etc. There are also finer points (e.g., handling of additionalProperties) I haven’t dug fully into.</p>  \n  \n<p>agentgateway implements OAuth-based MCP authentication. It exposes protected resource metadata at paths like <code>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/${resource}</code>. However, if one host contains multiple resources, should each resource’s route-match config explicitly include that resource’s well-known path? Otherwise you can’t guarantee the request will route to the well-known path handler. One nice thing: agentgateway adds CORS headers to metadata responses, so when an MCP client runs in a browser (e.g., the MCP inspector) you don’t need to add a separate CORS middleware.</p>  \n  \n<p>agentgateway fetches public keys from a JWKS path to verify tokens were issued by the corresponding authorization server. There are two JWKS sources:</p>  \n  \n<ol>  \n<li>The user supplies a URL or a file path.  \n</li>  \n<li>The JWKS URL is derived from the issuer URL and issuer type.</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<p>The code that gets public keys from JWKS appears to be called <a href=\"https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/blob/1ca00e32d3f475539a20120f72c45c05aaf80377/crates/agentgateway/src/types/local.rs#L1076\">only when parsing configuration</a>. So the JWKS does not seem to be periodically refreshed.</p>  \n  \n<p>Authorization is also implemented via OAuth. It uses a list of CEL expressions as filters, matching on JWT fields and MCP attributes. Example:<br>  \n</p>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code>mcpAuthorization:  \n  rules:  \n  # Allow anyone to call 'echo'  \n  - 'mcp.tool.name == \"echo\"'  \n  # Only the test-user can call 'add'  \n  - 'jwt.sub == \"test-user\" &amp;&amp; mcp.tool.name == \"add\"'  \n  # Any authenticated user with the claim `nested.key == value` can access 'printEnv'  \n  - 'mcp.tool.name == \"printEnv\" &amp;&amp; jwt.nested.key == \"value\"'  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<p>Note: in multiplexing scenarios, mcpAuthorization runs before the tool lists are merged, so the tool names here do not include the backend-name prefix.</p>  \n  \n<p>agentgateway provides surprisingly few MCP-related metrics — basically just an mcp_requests counter — so you can’t see details like which tools are taking the most time.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  A2A  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>For A2A protocol scenarios, agentgateway implements two main features:</p>  \n  \n<ol>  \n<li>Rewrites agent card URLs so they point to the gateway instead of the proxied backend.  \n</li>  \n<li>Parses A2A JSON requests and records the request method for observability.</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Proxying inference requests to LLM providers  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Like other AI gateways, agentgateway can proxy inference requests to LLM providers. This proxying is not just raw forwarding: it adds value such as token-based observability and rate-limiting.</p>  \n  \n<p>When proxying SSE traffic it collects token usage and TTFT metrics. For non-SSE streaming formats (e.g., Bedrock’s AWS event stream) it provides dedicated parsers.</p>  \n  \n<p>I’ll dive into rate limiting, prompt protection, and related features in a follow-up.</p>  \n  \n<p>Another common capability is to lift some LLM client features into the gateway to reduce integration work — for example, smoothing differences between providers and offering an OpenAI-compatible external API.</p>  \n  \n<p>agentgateway supports this to an extent. Its design is not a full generic \"X provider to Y provider\" converter; instead it implements conversions for specific routing types. Currently it supports two route types:</p>  \n  \n<ol>  \n<li>OpenAI’s /v1/chat/completions  \n</li>  \n<li>Anthropic’s /v1/messages</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<p>In practice both /v1/chat/completions and /v1/messages are chat-style routes: OpenAI’s /v1/chat/completions is functionally equivalent to Anthropic’s /v1/messages. They implemented both separately for quick business onboarding: many code agents only implement Anthropic’s /v1/messages, and special-casing that endpoint makes it easy to immediately accept such clients. Implementing a full Anthropic-to-any-provider converter would be a much larger effort.</p>  \n  \n<p>This area is currently roughly sufficient but incomplete. Putting aside support for embeddings, batching, etc., agentgateway does not fully support /v1/chat/completions yet — for example, <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs\">structured output</a> is not supported at the moment.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Inference Extension Support  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>When the gateway API inference extension (<a href=\"https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/\">https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/</a>) first appeared I was skeptical. Distributed inference is a systems engineering problem; it feels presumptuous for a single scheduler implementation to try to become the standard. But with Red Hat driving the LLMD project and treating the inference extension as part of an out-of-the-box experience, the inference extension may gain traction. Red Hat has invested heavily in AI projects (e.g., vLLM) and has the resources to advance this work.</p>  \n  \n<p>Supporting the inference extension is actually not hard. The gateway needs to forward inference requests to a scheduler (called EPP in the inference extension) via Envoy’s gRPC ext_proc protocol. The scheduler’s response includes an x-gateway-destination-endpoint header that contains the target upstream address. The gateway then forwards the inference request to that address. Practically speaking the gateway is only doing forwarding here; the core logic lives in the scheduler. I’ve wondered: if the entire request is sent to the scheduler, why not let the scheduler process the request directly instead of having the gateway forward it? Is the scheduler only capable of handling input tokens and not output tokens?</p>  \n  \n<p>What’s the value of a self-hosted inference system? I think it’s to, under data-security constraints, be reasonably cost-competitive with external LLM providers. Large-model inference benefits from scale economics greatly — a self-hosted system is unlikely to beat cloud providers purely on price. To be more cost-effective you need scheduling innovations (e.g., better load balancing, more flexible disaggregated serving). If inference-extension support just means forwarding requests to the official scheduler, then the gateway isn’t adding meaningful value in that part of the chain.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Summary  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>In summary, agentgateway is impressive for a project that’s been developed for only about half a year. Its feature richness stands out. It shows a clear focus on AI scenarios, and its ambition to rebuild the data plane in Rust (to replace the prior Envoy + Go external process approach) demonstrates strong intent and potential to address AI-specific protocols and performance needs.</p>  \n  \n<p>However, the documentation is incomplete: some implemented features (e.g., Anthropic /v1/messages support) <a href=\"https://github.com/agentgateway/website/blob/02e25020b185ed34c66704d6274708a24ffe098d/content/docs/llm/about.md?plain=1#L30\">aren’t documented</a>, while some documented items don’t exist in the code (e.g., the MCP metric list_calls_total referenced in the docs: <a href=\"https://github.com/agentgateway/website/blob/02e25020b185ed34c66704d6274708a24ffe098d/content/docs/mcp/mcp-observability.md?plain=1#L18\">https://github.com/agentgateway/website/blob/02e25020b185ed34c66704d6274708a24ffe098d/content/docs/mcp/mcp-observability.md?plain=1#L18</a>). Overall these are typical, understandable issues for a rapidly iterating early-stage open-source project and do not substantially detract from the project’s promise.</p>"

Solved! ...Really? Everything is fine for a while, and then <em>the workflow crashes because some corner case broke the YAML syntax</em>.

Use a <strong>preprocessing language</strong> guaranteed to produce valid syntax, like <a href=\"https://jsonnet.org/\">Jsonnet</a> for json? That wil work, for sure. However, you have now a <em>friction</em> problem: it's new file format that requires implementing its own toolchain (Jsonnet is not json, so editor add-ons, parsers, interpreters, libraries, etc.) and you will need to drive the team through the learning curve of a language with its own syntax and semantic. Will you implement a serious project... or will you have a coffee break at that point, and keep doing things the same old way?</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Enter YAMLpp  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Faced with that <strong>problem</strong>, I decided that it needed a <strong>straightforward solution</strong>, which required basically only <em>one</em> utility (a pre-processor) to convert files into static YAML, and would change nothing else anywhere.</p>  \n  \n<p>Enter <strong><a href=\"https://yamlpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">YAMLpp</a></strong> (<em>YAML Pre-Processor</em>). It is a language that makes YAML dynamic, but <em>it is itself YAML</em>.

Cloudflare’s global network began failing to deliver core HTTP traffic, generating a <a href=\"https://mgx.dev/blog/cloudflare1119\">flood of 5xx errors</a> to end users.</p> \n \n<p>This was not caused by an external attack or security problem.</p> \n \n<p>The outage stemmed from an internal \"latent defect\" triggered by a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/cloudflare-blames-massive-internet-outage-on-latent-bug/\">routine configuration change</a></p> \n \n<p>The failure fluctuated over time, until a fix was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/cloudflare-blames-massive-internet-outage-on-latent-bug/\">fully deployed</a>.</p> \n \n<p>The root cause lay in a software bug in Cloudflare’s Bot Management module and its downstream proxy logic.</p> \n \n<p>The Technical Chain of Events</p> \n \n<ol> \n<li><p><strong>Database Change (11:05 UTC)</strong>: A ClickHouse permissions update made previously implicit table access explicit, allowing users to see metadata from both the <code>default</code> and <code>r0</code> databases.</p></li> \n<li><p><strong>SQL Query Assumption</strong>: A Bot

\n<ol> \n<li><p><strong>Feature File Explosion</strong>: The machine learning feature file doubled from ~60 features to over 200 features with duplicate entries.</p></li> \n<li><p><strong>Hard Limit Exceeded</strong>: The Bot Management module had a hard-coded limit of 200 features (for memory pre-allocation), which was now exceeded.</p></li> \n<li><p><strong>The Fatal .unwrap()</strong>: The Rust code called <code>.unwrap()</code> on a Result that was now returning an error, causing the thread to panic with \"called Result::unwrap() on an Err value\". <em>see code below</em></p></li> \n<li><p><strong>Global Cascade</strong>: This panic propagated across all 330+ data centers globally, bringing down core CDN services, Workers KV, Cloudflare Access, Turnstile, and the

    "content": "<p><em>This article is brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.technewstoday.com/author/mduduzi/\">Mdu Sibisi</a>, draft.dev.</em></p> \n \n \n \n<p>Long <a href=\"https://software.land/build-time/\">build times</a> interfere with developer momentum, disrupt flow states, and negatively impact productivity. While seemingly minor gaps in work rate may appear negligible in the moment, they quickly accumulate into significant increases in release cycle times and infrastructure costs. (There’s a reason high-performance development teams <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/announcing-the-2024-dora-report\">run their CI/CD pipelines several times a day</a>).</p> \n \n \n \n<p>While it’s tempting to reach for the latest software or methodology that promises to maximize your engineering team’s output, carelessly swapping tools with a trial-and-error-like approach isn’t a good idea: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Omowunmi-Adebayo-4/publication/388122113_Software_Adoption_in_Project_Management_and_Their_Impact_on_Project_Efficiency_and_Collaboration/links/678b3b1f82501639f5f64d6e/Software-Adoption-in-Project-Management-and-Their-Impact-on-Project-Efficiency-and-Collaboration.pdf\">Premature adoption</a> can often do more harm than good. It’s far more effective to adopt a strategy informed by data, where you first identify leaks and performance bottlenecks and remedy them accordingly.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>After all, you must ensure your team is using the most optimal tools <em>and</em> that they’re using those tools optimally.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>This guide offers a three-phase blueprint for achieving significant CI/CD pipeline performance boosts that will stick around even as you scale:</p> \n \n \n \n<ul> \n<li>Identify: Pinpoint pipeline flaws.</li> \n \n \n \n<li>Optimize: Apply effective solutions.</li> \n \n \n \n<li>Continuously improve: Apply long-term strategies to avert future faults.</li> \n</ul> \n \n \n \n<h2><strong>Phase 1: Assess performance and identify bottlenecks</strong></h2> \n \n \n \n<p>Before attempting any optimization, first assess the current performance of your pipeline and identify the causes of poor performance. This allows you to make informed improvements and prove their value.</p> \n \n \n \n<p><em>Time</em> is one of the most reliable and straightforward metrics to start with, particularly in the early stages of your pipeline audit:</p> \n \n \n \n<ul> \n<li>How long does full pipeline completion take (from commit to production)?</li> \n \n \n \n<li>What is the average duration of each pipeline stage (build, test, and deploy)?</li> \n \n \n \n<li>Which steps consistently take the longest?</li> \n</ul> \n \n \n \n<p>Also, it’s important to survey or speak to developers about their time perception of the pipeline, and observe their behavior. They may be batching work or avoiding commits due to long feedback cycles.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>They might even be avoiding experimentation based on unhealthy cultures centered around “waiting for the build”.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>Use the data gathered from these sources to set and adjust your benchmarks and <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/service-level-agreement\">service-level agreements</a>, such as build duration (time) and CPU cores or memory usage (resource utilization).</p> \n \n \n \n<p>You don’t necessarily have to start with granular benchmarks and monitoring criteria per stage or process. You can keep it as broad as measuring overall pipeline completion time for the sake of simplicity.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>While legacy platforms might hide away data in text logs, modern CI/CD platforms provide you with the visibility you need to assess performance out of the box. </p> \n \n \n \n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/\">TeamCity</a>, the <em>Statistics</em> dashboard provides deeper insights into the performance of each build:</p> \n \n \n \n<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1_statistics-dashboard-in-teamcity.png\" alt=\"\"> \n \n \n \n<p>This view visualizes recent and historical build data using key metrics like build duration, success rate, test count, artifact size, and queue time. You can also create custom charts to track the metrics that matter the most to your business.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>For a more granular view, the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-time-report.html\"><em>Build Time</em> report</a> shows the time taken by each stage of your pipeline so you can pinpoint the most significant bottlenecks:</p> \n \n \n \n<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-2_build-time.png\" alt=\"\"> \n \n \n \n<p>By default, TeamCity attaches its <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/performance-monitor.html\">Performance Monitor</a> to each of your build configurations created from a URL. This provides you with a handy way of tracking resource utilization:</p> \n \n \n \n<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-3_perfmon.png\" alt=\"\"> \n \n \n \n<p>In addition to the Performance Monitor (and a host of other <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/adding-build-features.html\">build features</a>), TeamCity’s notifier can trigger real-time alerts for any important build events (such as fails, successful completions, or hangs) via email or Slack.</p> \n \n \n \n<h2><strong>Phase 2: Optimize performance</strong></h2> \n \n \n \n<p>Once you know what’s not working, you want to identify the highest-impact changes your team can make to boost performance.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>Avoid initiatives that may break the system or result in widespread interruptions, like upgrading build tools without validating downstream dependencies or switching shell or OS environments. Small incremental changes that can be isolated are the least likely to disrupt your team’s productivity and the easiest to trace and roll back if something goes wrong.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>Some sure-fire techniques that are usually relatively simple to apply include the following:</p> \n \n \n \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Build caches:</strong> Cache external (package manager) dependencies and build artifacts.</li> \n \n \n \n<li><strong>Parallelization:</strong> Run tests in parallel across agents or containers, splitting test suites by file, type, or historical timing data. You can also build microservices or modules concurrently.</li> \n \n \n \n<li><strong>Modularization:</strong> Break monolithic pipelines into modular build configurations.</li> \n \n \n \n<li><strong>Selective and incremental building:</strong> Use VCS triggers and path filters to build only affected modules. Use build fingerprint or checksums to avoid rebuilding unchanged components.</li> \n</ul> \n \n \n \n<p>TeamCity’s built-in features can help your team achieve several quick wins.For example, the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-cache.html\">build caches</a> can be enabled to intelligently reuse compiled artifacts and dependencies:</p> \n \n \n \n<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-4_build-with-cache-without-cache.png\" alt=\"\"> \n \n \n \n<p>In the example above, using a build cache reduced the build time by <strong>73 percent</strong>. (Keep in mind that the time you’ll save depends on the complexity of your build and which files you choose to cache.)</p> \n \n \n \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/artifact-dependencies.html\">Artifact dependencies</a> let you reuse files and curb any redundant compilation or build steps, allowing for pipeline modularization and faster executions:</p> \n \n \n \n<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-5_after-artifact-dependency-added.png\" alt=\"\"> \n \n \n \n<p>TeamCity’s architecture allows tests to run in parallel using separate <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/install-and-start-teamcity-agents.html\">build agents</a>. So instead of two (or more) builds running consecutively, they’ll run simultaneously, providing faster feedback to developers and thus shortening the release cycle:</p> \n \n \n \n<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-6_no-changes.png\" alt=\"\"> \n \n \n \n<h2><strong>Phase 3: Continuously improve</strong></h2> \n \n \n \n<p>Performance is not a one-off fix; it must be continually monitored and sustained as your team and codebase scale.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>Keep the following three considerations in mind to ensure continuous improvement:</p> \n \n \n \n<ul> \n<li>Use elastic infrastructure that can scale up to meet peak demand and scale down to save costs.</li> \n \n \n \n<li>Design pipelines that only build what has changed to speed up builds.</li> \n \n \n \n<li>Create a culture of performance: Empower your team with the necessary visibility and tools to track trends, catch regressions, and implement improvements.</li> \n</ul> \n \n \n \n<p>TeamCity supports continuous improvement, regardless of your scale. Its <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/cloud/teamcity-integration-with-cloud-solutions.html#Cloud+Agents+and+Executors\">cloud profiles</a> let you manage cloud agents on AWS, Azure, or GCP so you can scale infrastructure up and down to meet demand.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>When it comes to orchestration, you can use features like <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/snapshot-dependencies.html\">snapshot dependencies</a> to create build chains that only build the components impacted by change, which is crucial for managing microservices architecture and speeding up builds. <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-configuration-template.html#Creating+build+configuration+template\">Build templates</a>, on the other hand, allow your team to define a configuration once and apply it across multiple projects, which simplifies updates and maintenance.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>Finally, TeamCity’s <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/tracking-user-actions.html\">audit</a> log and historical performance reports offer the transparency and accountability needed for a performance-oriented culture by letting you track changes and share successes with stakeholders.</p> \n \n \n \n<img style=\"height:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-7_teamcity-audit.png\" alt=\"\"> \n \n \n \n<p>You can even use TeamCity’s REST API to export data into external tools such as Grafana and Excel to present to stakeholders.</p> \n \n \n \n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> \n \n \n \n<p>Implementing meaningful change is not always easy. However, by identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks and measuring progress, you and your team will be rewarded with visible improvements in product output and quality. Use this positive feedback to maintain your momentum.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>While addressing process bottlenecks is crucial to improving performance, the tools your team uses also shape the way they work. Legacy CI/CD tools that require extensive customization, external plugins, and specialized expertise often hinder performance because they keep teams stuck in ineffective workloads.</p> \n \n \n \n<p>If you’re secretly wondering whether your CI/CD setup is holding back your team, be sure to check out the following resources:</p> \n \n \n \n<ul> \n<li>Is your CI/CD tool helping or hindering performance?</li> \n \n \n \n<li>The migration decision framework: Quantify the risk of your legacy system to determine whether migration is worth consideration or not.</li> \n</ul>"

However, this domain faces two key challenges: (1) spatial constraints, driven by the requirements of the local-life scenario, where items are usually shown only to users within a limited geographic area, indirectly reducing their exposure probability; and (2) long-tail sparsity, where few popular items dominate user interactions, while many high-quality long-tail items are largely overlooked due to imbalanced interaction opportunities. Existing methods typically adopt a user-centric perspective, such as modeling spatial user preferences or enhancing long-tail representations with collaborative filtering signals. However, we argue that an item-centric perspective is more suitable for this domain, focusing on enhancing long-tail items representation that align with the spatially-constrained characteristics of local lifestyle services. To tackle this issue, we propose ReST, a Plug-And-Play Spatially-Constrained Representation Enhancement Framework for Long-Tail Local-Life Recommendation. Specifically, we first introduce a Meta ID Warm-up Network, which initializes fundamental ID representations by injecting their basic attribute-level semantic information. Subsequently, we propose a novel Spatially-Constrained ID Representation Enhancement Network (SIDENet) based on contrastive learning, which incorporates two efficient strategies: a spatially-constrained hard sampling strategy and a dynamic representation alignment strategy. This design adaptively identifies weak ID representations based on their attribute-level information during training. It additionally enhances them by capturing latent item relationships within the spatially-constrained characteristics of local lifestyle services, while preserving compatibility with popular items."

To address these, we propose MOON2.0, a dynamic modality-balanced multimodal representation learning framework for e-commerce product understanding. MOON2.0 comprises: (1) a Modality-driven Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module that adaptively processes input samples by their modality composition, enabling Multimodal Joint Learning to mitigate the modality imbalance; (2) a Dual-level Alignment method to better leverage semantic alignment properties inside individual products; and (3) an MLLM-based Image-text Co-augmentation strategy that integrates textual enrichment with visual expansion, coupled with Dynamic Sample Filtering to improve training data quality. We further introduce MBE2.0, a co-augmented multimodal representation benchmark for e-commerce representation learning and evaluation. Experiments show that MOON2.0 delivers state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MBE2.0 and multiple public datasets. Furthermore, attention-based heatmap visualization provides qualitative evidence of improved multimodal alignment of MOON2.0."

It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents. We also find that LDA is more internally consistent, as the multiple reruns return similar topics; however, these topics are not the true topics."

However, current memory-intensive algorithms, especially those used in big data systems, often overlook PCM's endurance limitations (10^6 to 10^8 writes before degradation) and write asymmetry. Self-balancing binary search trees (BSTs), which are widely used for large-scale data management, were developed without considering PCM's unique properties, leading to potential performance degradation. This paper introduces HART, a novel hybrid addressing scheme for self-balancing BSTs, designed to optimize PCM's characteristics. By combining DFATGray code addressing for deeper nodes with linear addressing for shallower nodes, HART balances reduced bit flips during frequent rotations at deeper levels with computational simplicity at shallow levels. Experimental results on PCM-aware AVL trees demonstrate significant improvements in performance, with a reduction in bit flips leading to enhanced endurance, increased lifetime, and lower write energy and latency. Notably, these benefits are achieved without imposing substantial computational overhead, making HART an efficient solution for big data applications."

    "content": "Few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection is a critical yet underexplored task, offering the ability to quickly adapt to complex industrial scenarios. In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Existing systems rely on CPU-based ANN indexing and filtering services, suffering from non-negligible costs and forgoing joint optimization opportunities. Such inefficiency makes them difficult to support more complex model architectures, such as learned similarities and multi-task retrieval. In this paper, we propose SilverTorch, a model-based system for serving recommendation models on GPUs. SilverTorch unifies model serving by replacing standalone indexing and filtering services with layers of served models. We propose a Bloom index algorithm on GPUs for feature filtering and a tensor-native fused Int8 ANN kernel on GPUs for nearest neighbor search. We further co-design the ANN search index and filtering index to reduce GPU memory utilization and eliminate unnecessary computation. Benefit from SilverTorch's serving paradigm, we introduce a OverArch scoring layer and a Value Model to aggregate results across multi-tasks. These advancements improve the accuracy for retrieval and enable future studies for serving more complex models. For ranking, SilverTorch's design accelerates item embedding calculation by caching the pre-calculated embeddings inside the serving model. Our evaluation on the industry-scale datasets show that SilverTorch achieves up to 5.6x lower latency and 23.7x higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We also demonstrate that SilverTorch's solution is 13.35x more cost-efficient than CPU-based solution while improving accuracy via serving more complex models. SilverTorch serves over hundreds of models online across major products and recommends contents for billions of daily active users."

Existing MSS methods mostly rely on loop closure detection for inter-session alignment; however, the performance of loop closure detection can be potentially degraded owing to the differences in the density and field of view (FoV) of the sensors used in different sessions. In this study, we challenge the existing paradigm that relies heavily on loop detection modules and propose a novel MSS framework, called Multi-Mapcher, that employs large-scale map-to-map registration to perform inter-session initial alignment, which is commonly assumed to be infeasible, by leveraging outlier-robust 3D point cloud registration. Next, after finding inter-session loops by radius search based on the assumption that the inter-session initial alignment is sufficiently precise, anchor node-based robust pose graph optimization is employed to build a consistent global map. As demonstrated in our experiments, our approach shows substantially better MSS performance for various LiDAR sensors used to capture the sessions and is faster than state-of-the-art approaches.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets.

However, existing generative models typically confine the generative paradigm to the training phase, primarily for representation learning. During online inference, they revert to a standard discriminative paradigm, failing to leverage their powerful generative capabilities to further improve prediction accuracy. This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases. Specifically, after acquiring generative capabilities by learning feature dependencies during training, SGCTR applies the generative capabilities during online inference to iteratively redefine the features of input samples, which mitigates the impact of noisy features and enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGCTR, demonstrating that applying the generative paradigm symmetrically across both training and inference significantly unlocks its power in CTR prediction."

However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search."

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments."

Our analysis leverages concepts from Lagrangian relaxation and duality theory to relate the dual function of the hard-constrained problem to the Q-function employed in Q-tree search and shows the connection between tree phase transitions and solutions to the dual problem obtained by exploiting the problem structure. An algorithm is proposed that employs knowledge of the tree phase transitions to find a setting of the dual variable that solves the dual problem. Furthermore, we present an alternative approach to select the dual variable that leverages the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained problem and the strong duality of linear programming. To obtain a linear program, we establish that a relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained tree-search problem has the integrality property by showing that the program constraint matrix is totally unimodular.

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs."

To optimize mineral processing circuits under uncertainty, we introduce an AI-driven approach that formulates mineral processing as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach in handling both feedstock uncertainty and process model uncertainty to optimize the operation of a simulated, simplified flotation cell as an example.

In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks."

We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments."

To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions."

In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies."

The framework employs n-gram language models to capture move patterns characteristic of specific player skill levels. By dividing players into seven distinct skill groups, from novice to expert, we trained separate models using data from the open-source chess platform Lichess. The framework dynamically selects the most suitable model for prediction tasks and generates player moves based on preceding sequences. \n  Evaluation on real-world game data demonstrates that the model selector module within the framework can classify skill levels with an accuracy of up to 31.7\\% when utilizing early game information (16 half-moves). The move prediction framework also shows substantial accuracy improvements, with our Selector Assisted Accuracy being up to 39.1\\% more accurate than our benchmark accuracy.

However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes."

We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: \"Diversity-Prioritized\" (MIM), \"Compression-Prioritized\" (AR), and \"Decoupled\" (Diffusion). Our analysis provides a principled explanation for their behavioral differences and informs a novel inference-time diversity enhancement technique."

To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation."

Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs."

With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference. Moreover, it consistently outperforms prior input-dependent noise approaches across most radii, with particularly large gains at radii 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, achieving relative improvements of 19%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. On ImageNet, dual RS remains effective across all radii. Additionally, the dual RS framework naturally provides a routing perspective for certified robustness, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off with off-the-shelf expert RS models."

    "content": "In the era of the Internet of Things and massive connectivity, many engineering applications, such as sensor fusion and federated edge learning, rely on efficient data aggregation from geographically distributed users over wireless networks. Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy."

    "content": "Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain. \n  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains."

Our key insight is that constraining the optimization space through a pre-trained base model and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can induce structure in weight space. Across reconstruction, generation, and analysis tasks on 2D and 3D data, we find that multiplicative LoRA weights achieve high representation quality while exhibiting distinctiveness and semantic structure. When used with latent diffusion models, multiplicative LoRA weights enable higher-quality generation than existing weight-space methods."

While the former has been extensively studied, omission-based deception remains largely overlooked, even though it can subtly guide readers toward false conclusions under the illusion of completeness. To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks."

We attribute this limitation to \\textbf{reasoning overconfidence}: a tendency to express undue certainty in an incomplete solution set. To examine the effect, we introduce \\textit{MuSoBench}, a benchmark of multi-solution problems. Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \\textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths. An attention-entropy analysis offers preliminary support for this view. These findings provide tools for assessing the completeness of LLM reasoning and highlight the need to move evaluation beyond single-answer accuracy toward comprehensive exploration."

We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor."

Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PMI alone already improves over existing string similarity measures such as NED and SCA, and that the combined similarity performs on par with or better than supervised baselines. An ablation study highlights the importance of character encoding, temperature settings and augmentation strategies. The approach scales to datasets of different sizes, works without manual supervision and is provided with a command-line tool that allows researchers to conduct their own studies."

Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but which one is right for your app? In this article, we'll dive into the details of each protocol and help you make an informed decision.<br><br>  \nSAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, is an XML-based protocol that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. It's commonly used for enterprise-level authentication, where security is paramount. On the other hand, OIDC, or OpenID Connect, is an OAuth-based protocol that provides a more standardized and flexible approach to authentication. It's perfect for web applications and services that require a high level of customization.<br><br>  \nBoth protocols have their advantages and disadvantages. SAML is more secure, but can be complex and inflexible. OIDC is more flexible, but may compromise on security. So, when should you use each? If you're building an enterprise-level application that requires top-notch security, SAML might be the way to go. But if you're building a web application that requires customization and flexibility, OIDC is the better choice.</p>  \n  \n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://iamdevbox.com/posts/saml-vs-oidc-when-to-use-which-protocol-in-2025/?utm_source=devto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=blog_post\">SAML vs OIDC: Choosing the Right Authentication Protocol for Your App</a></p>"

Why Candy Games Need Math (More Than You Think)</p> \n \n<p>A candy craze game appears simple:</p> \n \n<p>match 3 candies</p> \n \n<p>clear them</p> \n \n<p>trigger cascades</p> \n \n<p>refill the board</p> \n \n<p>But fairness and difficulty depend on precisely controlled randomness.</p> \n \n<p>If the game is too random → players feel cheated.<br> \nIf it is too predictable → boredom.</p> \n \n<p>The solution: guided randomness backed by probability design.</p> \n \n<p>🎲 2. Generating the Board: Not Fully Random</p> \n \n<p>Most beginners try this:</p> \n \n<p>grid[r][c] = randomCandy();</p> \n \n<p>But this often produces:</p> \n \n<p>instant combos at start (unfair advantage)</p> \n \n<p>unwinnable states</p> \n \n<p>repetitive patterns</p> \n \n<p>too many cascades</p> \n \n<p>A professional candy craze game uses “no-initial-matches” logic.<br> \nfunction generateCell(r, c) {<br> \n  let tile;<br> \n  do {<br> \n    tile = randomCandy();<br> \n  } while (<br> \n    matchesLeft(r, c, tile) ||   // avoid horizontal match<br> \n    matchesUp(r, c, tile)        // avoid vertical match<br> \n  );<br> \n  return tile;<br> \n}</p> \n \n<p>This ensures fair starts while still feeling random.</p> \n \n<p>📉 3. Probability Balancing (Weighted Randomness)</p> \n \n<p>If all candies have equal probability:</p> \n \n<p>Math.random() &lt; 1 / candyTypes</p> \n \n<p>the game may generate:</p> \n \n<p>too many large combo chains</p> \n \n<p>too few matches</p> \n \n<p>impossible boards</p> \n \n<p>Developers solve this using weighted probability tables:</p> \n \n<p>const weights = {<br> \n  red: 0.20,<br> \n  blue: 0.20,<br> \n  yellow: 0.20,<br> \n  green: 0.20,<br> \n  purple: 0.20,<br> \n  // rare types (e.g., special candies)<br> \n  rainbow: 0.02<br> \n};</p> \n \n<p>This allows designers to tune game feel without changing code.</p> \n \n<p>🌊 4. Cascade Logic: “Chain Reactions” That Feel Good</p> \n \n<p>The emotional peak of a candy craze game is the cascade:</p> \n \n<p>Match 3</p> \n \n<p>They disappear</p> \n \n<p>Above tiles fall</p> \n \n<p>New tiles fill</p> \n \n<p>New matches occur</p> \n \n<p>Repeat</p> \n \n<p>The math behind cascades:</p> \n \n<p>A cascade continues as long as there is a match:</p> \n \n<p>function cascade() {<br> \n  let totalCleared = 0;<br> \n  let matches;</p> \n \n<p>do {<br> \n    matches = findMatches(grid);<br> \n    clearMatches(matches);<br> \n    applyGravity(grid);<br> \n    refillGrid(grid);<br> \n    totalCleared += matches.length;<br> \n  } while (matches.length &gt; 0);</p> \n \n<p>return totalCleared;<br> \n}</p> \n \n<p>This often results in “lucky streaks,” but even those streaks are mathematically predictable based on candy distribution.</p> \n \n<p>📈 5. Level Pacing: The Secret Ingredient</p> \n \n<p>Great candy games feel like this:</p> \n \n<p>Easy start</p> \n \n<p>Moderate difficulty</p> \n \n<p>Tension rise</p> \n \n<p>Mini breather</p> \n \n<p>Challenge spike</p> \n \n<p>Reward moment</p> \n \n<p>Continue loop</p> \n \n<p>This pacing is algorithm driven.</p> \n \n<p>Controlled difficulty curve:</p> \n \n<p>early levels → high match probability</p> \n \n<p>mid levels → introduce obstacles (jelly, blockers, frozen tiles)</p> \n \n<p>late levels → reduce match probability</p> \n \n<p>Example tuning:</p> \n \n<p>function getSpawnWeights(level) {<br> \n  if (level &lt; 5) return easyWeights;<br> \n  if (level &lt; 15) return mediumWeights;<br> \n  return hardWeights;<br> \n}</p> \n \n<p>Difficulty becomes predictable, testable, and adjustable without touching core code.</p> \n \n<p>🔥 6. Special Candies: Probability + Trigger Rules</p> \n \n<p>Special candies (e.g., bombs, striped candies, color blasters) are generated by:</p> \n \n<p>clearing 4</p> \n \n<p>clearing 5</p> \n \n<p>forming T or L shapes</p> \n \n<p>chaining certain combos</p> \n \n<p>Special candy detection logic:</p> \n \n<p>function detectSpecial(matches) {<br> \n  if (matches.length === 4) return \"line\";<br> \n  if (matches.length === 5) return \"rainbow\";<br> \n  if (isTShape(matches) || isLShape(matches)) return \"bomb\";<br> \n}</p> \n \n<p>These rules drastically impact:</p> \n \n<p>board predictability</p> \n \n<p>chain potential</p> \n \n<p>player satisfaction</p> \n \n<p>difficulty scaling</p> \n \n<p>Again—mathematics at work.</p> \n \n<p>🎮 7. Why Candy Craze Games Are Ideal for HTML5</p> \n \n<p>HTML5 (Canvas or WebGL) perfectly matches this genre:</p> \n \n<p>grid logic is lightweight</p> \n \n<p>animations are small and repeated</p> \n \n<p>user input is simple</p> \n \n<p>scene transitions are minimal</p> \n \n<p>game loop works at 60 FPS</p> \n \n<p>assets are easy to compress</p> \n \n<p>mobile browsers handle it well</p> \n \n<p>Even large animations can be optimized with:</p> \n \n<p>sprite atlases</p> \n \n<p>batched draw calls</p> \n \n<p>GPU-accelerated WebGL pipelines</p> \n \n<p>This is why many modern candy craze games run entirely in browsers.</p> \n \n<p>🌐 8.

    "content": "Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding."

These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors. Applying LitMOF to the experimental MOF database (the CSD MOF Subset), we constructed LitMOF-DB, a curated set 118,464 computation-ready structures, including corrections of 69% (6,161 MOFs) of the invalid MOFs in the latest CoRE MOF database. Additionally, the system uncovered 12,646 experimentally reported MOFs absent from existing resources, substantially expanding the known experimental design space. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward self-correcting scientific databases and a generalizable paradigm for LLM-driven curation in materials science."

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms."

We introduce a preference-driven learning pipeline that infers latent fairness objectives directly from human pairwise preferences over feasible decisions. A novel Siamese neural network is developed to generate convex quadratic cost functions conditioned on contextual information. The resulting surrogate objectives align optimization outcomes with human-perceived fairness while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation scenario. This study provides an actionable path toward embedding human-centered fairness in the design of autonomous decision-making systems."

Our algorithm is inspired by the principles of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in Computer Vision, which aligns representations across different modalities under the philosophy that ''two modalities representing the same concept should have similar representations.'' The central idea here is that the instruction and corresponding policy of a task represent the same concept, the task itself, in two different modalities. Therefore, by extending the idea of CLIP to RL, our method creates a unified representation space for natural language and policy embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in achieving faster transfer across tasks."

This landmark result kicked off decades of research on designing linear or nearly linear-time algorithms on planar graphs. In an attempt to generalize Lipton-Tarjan's theorem to nonplanar graphs, Alon, Seymour, and Thomas [STOC '90, Journal of the AMS '90] showed that any minor-free graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$ that can be found in $O(n^{3/2})$ time. The superlinear running time in their separator theorem is a key bottleneck for generalizing algorithmic results from planar to minor-free graphs. Despite extensive research for more than two decades, finding a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$ in (linear) $O(n)$ time for minor-free graphs remains a major open problem. Known algorithms either give a separator of size much larger than $O(\\sqrt{n})$ or have superlinear running time, or both. \n  In this paper, we answer the open problem affirmatively. Our algorithm is very simple: it runs a vertex-weighted variant of breadth-first search (BFS) a constant number of times on the input graph. Our key technical contribution is a weighting scheme on the vertices to guide the search for a balanced separator, offering a new connection between the size of a balanced separator and the existence of a clique-minor model. We believe that our weighting scheme may be of independent interest."

To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors."

First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications."

    "content": "We propose an always-feasible quadratic programming (QP) optimizer, FlexQP, which is based on an exact relaxation of the QP constraints. If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs."

We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages. Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts. The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms. It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages."

With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity."

We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches."

However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/m2m-70."

By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods. This work bridges the tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone."

However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions. \n  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker. \n  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment."

Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context."

Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods."

Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \\emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \\emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general.

Choosing the Right HTML5 Engine</p> \n \n<p>For a crazy pizza game, any of the major HTML5 engines can work:</p> \n \n<p>✔ Phaser</p> \n \n<p>Most common choice</p> \n \n<p>Great for 2D animations, sprites, state machines</p> \n \n<p>Built-in physics and input systems</p> \n \n<p>✔ PixiJS</p> \n \n<p>Perfect for fast rendering</p> \n \n<p>Good for animation-heavy gameplay</p> \n \n<p>✔ Pure JavaScript + Canvas</p> \n \n<p>Best for lightweight casual games</p> \n \n<p>Minimal engine overhead</p> \n \n<p>Great performance on mobile</p> \n \n<p>Here’s a small example of a simple pizza ingredient click-handler using vanilla JS:</p> \n \n<p>canvas.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) =&gt; {<br> \n  const x = e.offsetX;<br> \n  const y = e.offsetY;</p> \n \n<p>ingredients.forEach(item =&gt; {<br> \n    if (item.isClicked(x, y)) {<br> \n      item.select();<br> \n      score++;<br> \n    }<br> \n  });<br> \n});</p> \n \n<p>The core interaction is simple — which is why many successful HTML5 pizza games are under 200 KB in script size.</p> \n \n<p>🎮 3. Designing the Core Gameplay Loop</p> \n \n<p>Every successful crazy pizza game relies on a tight loop:</p> \n \n<p>Display random ingredients</p> \n \n<p>Player selects or assembles them</p> \n \n<p>Timer decreases or speed increases</p> \n \n<p>Feedback (points, sounds, animations)</p> \n \n<p>New round begins instantly</p> \n \n<p>A clean gameplay loop example:</p> \n \n<p>function gameLoop() {<br> \n  spawnIngredients();</p> \n \n<p>timer.start(30);</p> \n \n<p>timer.onTick(() =&gt; updateUI());</p> \n \n<p>timer.onEnd(() =&gt; {<br> \n    endGame(score);<br> \n  });<br> \n}</p> \n \n<p>The trick is to keep everything fast and readable, especially since mobile players have less patience for lag.</p> \n \n<p>🎨 4. Graphics &amp; Assets Optimization</p> \n \n<p>Crazy pizza games often include dozens of PNG icons:</p> \n \n<p>Sauce</p> \n \n<p>Cheese</p> \n \n<p>Pepperoni</p> \n \n<p>Mushroom</p> \n \n<p>Onion</p> \n \n<p>Oven effects</p> \n \n<p>Combo icons<br> \n…and more.</p> \n \n<p>To keep performance high:</p> \n \n<p>✔ Use sprite sheets instead of individual images<br> \n✔ Compress PNGs with TinyPNG or Squoosh<br> \n✔ Preload assets before starting the game<br> \n✔ Keep your texture count low to reduce GPU swaps</p> \n \n<p>A typical loading script:</p> \n \n<p>const assets = [<br> \n  \"pizza-base.png\",<br> \n  \"pepperoni.png\",<br> \n  \"cheese.png\",<br> \n  \"combo.png\",<br> \n  \"timer.png\"<br> \n];</p> \n \n<p>Promise.all(assets.map(loadImage)).then(startGame);</p> \n \n<p>📱 5. Mobile Performance Best Practices</p> \n \n<p>Since most crazy pizza game players are on mobile browsers, optimization is essential:</p> \n \n<p>Avoid unnecessary DOM updates</p> \n \n<p>Use a single  when possible</p> \n \n<p>Keep animation frame rates stable (use requestAnimationFrame)</p> \n \n<p>Minify and bundle your scripts</p> \n \n<p>Limit physics calculations</p> \n \n<p>Pre-calculate ingredient positions</p> \n \n<p>Even a simple change like caching your ingredient hit-boxes can improve performance dramatically.</p> \n \n<p>🔊 6.

As businesses and developers race to integrate these powerful tools, a key consideration often arises: cost. The good news? AI service providers understand this need for accessible innovation, and exciting promotions on AI models, subscriptions, and paid plan benefits are blooming!</p>  \n  \n<p>This post dives into the current landscape of AI service promotions, helping you identify opportunities to maximize your AI budget, experiment with new technologies, and scale your projects without breaking the bank. Whether you're a startup, a seasoned enterprise, or an individual developer, there's likely a deal waiting to amplify your AI journey.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Why Promotions Matter in the AI Space  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>The competitive nature of the AI market means providers are constantly vying for your attention. This creates a fantastic environment for consumers, leading to a variety of promotional offers designed to:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>Attract New Users:</strong> Lower the barrier to entry for those curious about AI.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Encourage Adoption:</strong> Help users explore full feature sets without immediate heavy investment.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Reward Loyalty:</strong> Provide incentives for long-term commitment.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Boost Usage:</strong> Offer tiered pricing or credit bonuses that make scaling more appealing.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Showcase New Features:</strong> Entice users to try cutting-edge models or services.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Navigating the AI Promotion Landscape: Key Categories and Types of Deals  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Promotions on AI services typically fall into several categories, each catering to different needs and scales of operation.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  1. Cloud AI Platform Credits &amp; Free Tiers (AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud)  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Major cloud providers are often the first stop for AI infrastructure, offering a vast array of machine learning services, compute power, and specialized AI APIs.</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>Extended Free Tiers:</strong> While perpetual free tiers exist for basic services, many providers offer <em>extended</em> free periods (e.g., 6-12 months) for specific AI services or higher usage limits for new accounts. This is perfect for prototyping and initial development.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Startup Credits:</strong> Cloud providers frequently partner with startup accelerators or offer direct programs providing substantial credits (often thousands of dollars) for qualifying startups. These can be a game-changer for early-stage companies building AI-first products.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Compute Instance Discounts:</strong> Look for promotional pricing on GPU-enabled virtual machines or specialized AI accelerators, particularly for new regions or during specific seasonal campaigns.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Managed Service Discounts:</strong> Occasionally, specific managed AI services (like cognitive services, MLOps platforms, or data labeling tools) will feature discounted usage rates for a limited time.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  2. Generative AI Model API Subscriptions &amp; Credit Bundles  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>The explosion of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation, and other generative AI has led to a new wave of API-first providers. These are hotbeds for promotions.</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>New User Credit Bonuses:</strong> Many platforms offer a bonus amount of credits when you sign up or make your first purchase. For example, \"Buy 100,000 tokens, get 50,000 free.\"</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Discounted Monthly/Annual Subscriptions:</strong> Opting for an annual plan often provides a significant discount compared to month-to-month billing. Some providers also offer introductory rates for the first few months of a new subscription tier.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Tiered Pricing Incentives:</strong> While not strictly a promotion, many providers structure their pricing such that higher volume usage (e.g., more API calls, more tokens) comes with a lower per-unit cost. Promotions might temporarily lower the threshold for these higher tiers.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Early Access Programs:</strong> Be on the lookout for beta programs or early access to new, advanced models. These sometimes come with reduced pricing or free usage periods in exchange for feedback.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  3. AI Development Tools &amp; MLOps Platform Premium Features  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Beyond just the models, the tools you use to build, deploy, and manage AI models also offer promotional opportunities.</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>IDE &amp; Workbench Trials/Discounts:</strong> Premium features in AI-focused IDEs or collaborative MLOps workbenches might offer extended free trials or significant discounts for annual licenses.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Feature Unlocks:</strong> Some platforms might temporarily unlock advanced features (e.g., parallel experimentation, advanced monitoring, more robust security) for existing users to encourage upgrades.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Bundle Deals:</strong> Occasionally, MLOps platforms might bundle their services with cloud compute credits or integrate third-party tools at a discounted rate.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  4. Specialized AI Services (Data Annotation, Custom Model Training)  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Even highly specialized services can have promotional windows.</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>First Project Discounts:</strong> Companies offering data annotation, custom model fine-tuning, or specific AI consulting services might offer a discount on your first project to demonstrate their capabilities.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Volume-Based Tiers:</strong> Similar to API usage, larger projects for data labeling or custom training often receive better per-unit pricing.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Maximizing Your Savings: Tips for Leveraging AI Promotions  \n</h2>  \n  \n<ol>  \n<li> <strong>Read the Fine Print:</strong> Always understand the terms – duration, usage limits, eligibility, and what happens after the promotional period ends.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Plan Your Projects:</strong> Align your development roadmap with promotional offers. If you know you'll need a specific AI service in a few months, check for upcoming or current deals.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Explore New Providers:</strong> Don't limit yourself to one vendor. New entrants often have aggressive promotions to gain market share.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Join Beta Programs:</strong> Access to cutting-edge AI features often comes with reduced costs or free usage during the testing phase.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Leverage Startup Programs:</strong> If you're a startup, actively seek out and apply for startup credit programs from major cloud and AI service providers.</li>  \n<li> <strong>Stay Subscribed:</strong> Sign up for newsletters and follow social media channels of your preferred AI service providers. Promotions are often announced there first.</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The Undeniable Value of Paid AI Plans  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>While promotions are fantastic for cost savings, remember the inherent value of paid AI plans:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>Reliability &amp; Performance:</strong> Guaranteed uptime, faster response times, and dedicated resources.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Higher Usage Limits:</strong> Crucial for scaling production-grade applications.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Dedicated Support:</strong> Access to technical assistance when you need it most.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Advanced Features:</strong> Access to cutting-edge models, fine-tuning capabilities, security features, and MLOps tools unavailable in free tiers.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Compliance &amp; Security:</strong> Robust features to meet enterprise-grade security and compliance requirements.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Conclusion: Seize the AI Opportunity  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>The current wave of promotions on AI services presents an incredible opportunity. Whether you're looking to integrate an advanced LLM, power sophisticated image generation, build robust MLOps pipelines, or simply experiment with the latest AI models, there's never been a better time to invest. By strategically leveraging these offers, you can significantly reduce your initial outlay, accelerate your development, and unlock the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence for your projects and business.</p>  \n  \n<p>Don't let budget constraints hold you back from innovation. Start exploring these promotions today and take your AI initiatives to the next level!</p>"

It helps identify performance bottlenecks, establish baselines, and ensure applications can handle anticipated traffic.</p>  \n  \n<p>Stress Testing pushes systems beyond normal operational capacity to determine breaking points and understand failure modes. Unlike load testing, which validates performance under expected conditions, stress testing explores system behavior at and beyond limits.<br>  \n1.2 Conventional Load Testing Types</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.2.1 Baseline Testing<br>  \nPurpose: Establish performance benchmarks under normal conditions</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>Metrics: Response times, throughput, resource utilization</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Case: Initial performance assessment, regression testing</p>  \n  \n<p>Typical Scenario: Simulating average daily users with normal behavior patterns</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.2.2 Load Testing<br>  \nPurpose: Verify system behavior under expected peak load</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>Metrics: Error rates, latency at peak, throughput capacity</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Case: Pre-deployment validation, capacity planning</p>  \n  \n<p>Typical Scenario: Simulating Black Friday traffic for e-commerce</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.2.3 Stress Testing<br>  \nPurpose: Identify maximum capacity and breaking points</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>Metrics: System failure points, recovery behavior, error handling</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Case: Determining scalability limits, disaster recovery planning</p>  \n  \n<p>Typical Scenario: Gradual increase until system failure</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.2.4 Soak Testing (Endurance Testing)<br>  \nPurpose: Identify performance degradation over extended periods</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>Metrics: Memory leaks, resource exhaustion, response time drift</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Case: Long-running process validation, memory management testing</p>  \n  \n<p>Typical Scenario: 24-72 hour continuous load simulation</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.2.5 Spike Testing<br>  \nPurpose: Evaluate system response to sudden traffic surges</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>Metrics: Recovery time, error spikes, system stability</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Case: Handling viral content, emergency notifications</p>  \n  \n<p>Typical Scenario: Instant 10x traffic increase for 5 minutes</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.2.6 Volume Testing<br>  \nPurpose: Test system with large amounts of data</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>Metrics: Database performance, storage utilization, data processing time</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Case: Big data applications, reporting systems</p>  \n  \n<p>Typical Scenario: Processing millions of records simultaneously</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.2.7 Scalability Testing<br>  \nPurpose: Verify system performance as resources increase</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>Metrics: Linear scaling capability, resource efficiency</p>  \n  \n<p>Use Case: Horizontal scaling validation, cloud resource planning</p>  \n  \n<p>Typical Scenario: Adding nodes/containers while increasing load</p>  \n  \n<blockquote>  \n<p>1.3 Advanced Stress Analogies from Material Science<br>  \nModern distributed systems exhibit behaviors remarkably similar to physical materials under stress. Understanding these analogies helps identify subtle performance issues that conventional testing might miss.</p>  \n  \n<p>1.3.1 Residual Stresses<br>  \nDefinition: Internal stresses that remain in a system after the original cause of stress has been removed.</p>  \n</blockquote>  \n  \n<p>System Analog: Performance degradation lingering after high-load events</p>  \n  \n<p>Examples:</p>  \n

Unlike traditional debate apps, this platform is designed to <strong>analyze your performance on the fly</strong>, track your improvement, and help you refine your skills through AI-powered insights.</p>  \n  \n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>  \n  \n<ol>  \n<li>Enter a debate topic, for example: <em>\"Impact of Pollution on Living Organisms\"</em>  \n</li>  \n<li>Choose your debate style: <strong>Coach mode</strong> for supportive feedback or <strong>Fierce mode</strong> for challenging opposition.</li>  \n<li>Configure your Gemini API key, hit <strong>Start Debate</strong>, and the AI engages you in natural conversation.</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<p>During the debate, the interface shows live transcription, audio visualization, and a running timer. When the debate ends, you receive a <strong>comprehensive performance report</strong> including:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Vocabulary Richness</strong> – tracks your lexical diversity.</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Confidence Level</strong> – analyzes speech patterns and delivery.</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Argument Strength</strong> – evaluates logical structure and evidence.</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Response Time</strong> – measures how quickly you counter arguments.</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Engagement Score</strong> – tracks active participation.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>The AI also generates <strong>personalized suggestions</strong> to improve your debating skills.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Tracking Progress and Persona Analysis  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>DebateMaster AI isn’t just a one-time experience. The <strong>Activity tab</strong> visualizes your progress through score trends, heatmaps, and session history. Additionally, the <strong>Persona system</strong> assigns a debate archetype – Strategist, Orator, Analyst, or Diplomat – showing your strengths and evolution over time. Achievements like <em>Vocabulary Master</em> or <em>Debate Marathon</em> gamify the learning experience.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  How Kiro IDE Made This Possible  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>The real star behind the scenes is <strong>Kiro IDE</strong>. I used:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Multi-Spec Development</strong> – I split the project into four independent specs: core debate functionality, activity view, persona system, and UI redesign. This allowed parallel development without conflicts.</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Steering Documents</strong> – ensured consistent styling, architecture, and API usage across features.</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Agent Hooks</strong> – automated repetitive tasks like linting, grammar checking, and README updates, saving hours of manual work.</li>  \n<li>  \n<strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> – integrated live documentation for Gemini API, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind, so Kiro always had the latest references.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>This workflow accelerated development, improved code quality, and let me focus on building the best user experience rather than boilerplate tasks.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Why DebateMaster AI Matters  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Whether you’re a student preparing for competitions, a professional improving public speaking, or someone who wants to sharpen critical thinking, DebateMaster AI offers a <strong>complete coaching platform</strong>. In just six weeks, the combination of AI-assisted development and Kiro IDE helped me turn a complex idea into a polished, fully functional app.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Try It Out  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>DebateMaster AI is more than a hackathon project – it’s a learning platform. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/abbasmir12/debatemasterai\">repository</a> and give it a try. Your next debate could be your best one yet!</p>"

The solution? Introducing Better Auth API: a framework-independent authentication service designed to revolutionize user management implementation. This detailed tutorial will guide you through creating a fully functional, full-stack application, showcasing the efficiency and ease of Better Auth, powered by Astro for optimal performance.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Why Better Auth?  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Traditional auth solutions often require extensive boilerplate code and complex configuration. Better Auth offers:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Zero boilerplate setup</li>  \n<li>Type-safe APIs with full TypeScript support</li>  \n<li>Multiple provider support (email/password, OAuth, passkeys)</li>  \n<li>Framework-agnostic design that works with Astro, React, and beyond</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Better Auth automatically handles Astro's unique server-client boundary, providing authentication that works across both environments. Better Auth provides a unified API that adapts to your stack—whether you're using React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript on the frontend, and Node.js, Bun, Deno or any framekworks on javascript ecosystem on the backend. </p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Setting up Astro  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Astro's hybrid architecture (server and client components) works seamlessly with Better Auth. Better Auth requires a database to persist user and session data and leverages Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to manage sessions via cookies.</p>  \n  \n<p>🛠️ Prerequisites</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>A new Astro project (e.g., initialized with pnpm create astro@latest).</li>  \n<li>A database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) configured and ready.</li>  \n<li>An SSR adapter for Astro (e.g., Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, or Node) added to your project.  \n</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<div>  \n<pre><code>pnpm create astro@latest  \n</code></pre>  \n  \n</div>  \n  \n  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Create a Neon (Serverless Postgres) app  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>If you do not have one already, create a Neon (Serverless Postgres) project. </p>  \n  \n<p>Save your connection details including your password.

Companies launching exchanges, custody solutions, OTC desks, tokenization platforms or payment systems must now comply with a unified regulatory structure that is far more demanding than the previous patchwork of national rules. Preparing for authorization requires a strategic, methodical and well-organized approach that goes far beyond producing a few basic compliance documents.</p>  \n  \n<p>MiCA introduces a new regulatory architecture designed to ensure consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability. It defines a complete framework for authorization, governance, internal controls, AML procedures, ICT security, operational resilience and oversight. Companies entering the EU market must understand that authorization is not a one-time formality but a long-term commitment to maintaining a high degree of organizational discipline.</p>  \n  \n<p>One of the most challenging aspects of preparing for authorization is realizing how interconnected the requirements are. A company cannot simply create a standalone AML policy or a single risk statement. Every procedure must align with operational reality, governance structure, staffing, technology and internal oversight. Regulators expect consistency across all documentation, and even small discrepancies between internal policies can lead to questions or delays. Many applications fail because companies assemble documents from different sources without ensuring they reflect a coherent internal system.</p>  \n  \n<p>Another common barrier arises from governance. MiCA requires a clear organizational structure, well-defined responsibilities, transparent management roles and reliable control functions. Regulators want to see real oversight, not symbolic titles. Senior management must be fit and proper, competent and actively involved in the company’s operations. Decision-making processes need to be documented and supported by actual workflows. Applicants who treat governance as a checkbox exercise often face long regulator feedback cycles.</p>  \n  \n<p>Operational resilience is another crucial area. Companies must demonstrate that they have considered incident response, business continuity, third-party dependencies, cybersecurity, data protection, operational risks and ICT vulnerabilities. Regulatory expectations include the ability to detect, manage and report incidents effectively. If a company relies heavily on outsourced technology, it must show that it remains fully responsible for oversight and control. Regulators are particularly cautious about technology providers located outside the EU or in jurisdictions with weak regulatory safeguards.</p>  \n  \n<p>AML and CTF compliance remains one of the toughest components. Companies must design robust onboarding procedures, transaction monitoring tools, risk scoring models, suspicious activity processes, record-keeping methods and continuous review mechanisms. The Travel Rule must be fully integrated into operational systems. Regulators want proof that a company can detect high-risk behavior and respond appropriately. Many applicants underestimate the technical complexity of AML implementation and rely too heavily on third-party KYC tools without building internal procedures that reflect their business model.</p>  \n  \n<p>ICT and cybersecurity requirements are heavily influenced by the Digital Operational Resilience Act. Although MiCA and DORA are separate frameworks, they interact closely. Applicants must show that their systems are secure, resilient and regularly tested. Documentation must cover access controls, encryption, monitoring, incident detection, penetration testing, data protection and disaster recovery. Companies need to provide evidence that their systems are not only designed securely but are maintained securely through ongoing operational processes.</p>  \n  \n<p>Another area that often leads to rejections is the lack of consistency between business plans and internal controls. If a company claims it will offer a large range of activities but provides minimal staffing or insufficient capital, regulators will immediately question the feasibility of the business model. Financial projections must be realistic, risk-aware and aligned with the resources described in the application. Underestimating capital or staffing needs can significantly delay the authorization process.</p>  \n  \n<p>Despite the complexity of authorization, companies that prepare early and treat the process seriously can navigate it successfully. Clear documentation, consistent internal controls, realistic planning and structured governance significantly increase the chances of approval. It is also essential to maintain open communication with the regulator, respond quickly to feedback and update policies when required. Regulators appreciate transparency and professionalism, and companies that demonstrate commitment tend to complete the process more efficiently.</p>  \n  \n<p>Regulatory advisory firms like <a href=\"https://licensium.io/\">Licensium</a>  help companies manage the entire authorization journey. They assist with governance design, AML documentation, ICT frameworks, risk assessment, internal policies, application preparation and communication with regulators. This level of professional support is often decisive, especially for companies without dedicated compliance teams. By organizing the authorization process from the beginning, firms significantly reduce the risk of delays and accelerate the approval timeline.</p>  \n  \n<p>As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, businesses that invest in compliance and operational maturity gain long-term advantages. MiCA introduces clear rules that reward stability, transparency and responsible management. Companies that adapt proactively will be better positioned to enter the European market, expand their operations and build trust with users and partners. A strong regulatory foundation is not only a legal requirement but also a strategic asset in a competitive global industry.</p>  \n  \n<p>Preparing for MiCA authorization is a complex yet achievable process. With the right structure, documentation and strategic planning, crypto businesses can meet the new standards and establish themselves as credible, compliant and resilient participants in the European market. The companies that take regulation seriously today will become the leaders of tomorrow’s digital asset ecosystem.</p>"

These frameworks abstract many of the lower-level components, allowing teams to focus on business logic instead of reinventing infrastructure.</p>  \n  \n<p>This raises an important question for engineers: <strong>Is it still worth building a blockchain entirely from scratch, like Bitcoin, or is relying on an SDK the practical approach in 2026?</strong><br>  \nThis blog breaks down the engineering reality.</p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1. What “from scratch” really means in blockchain engineering</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>Many people think building a blockchain from scratch means creating new block types and hashing them. In reality, a “true from-scratch blockchain” requires implementing several subsystems:</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.1 Network Layer</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Responsible for:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Peer discovery</li>  \n<li>Message propagation</li>  \n<li>Gossip protocol</li>  \n<li>Maintaining network topology</li>  \n<li>Flood protection</li>  \n<li>Peer scoring</li>  \n<li>Bandwidth control</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>This layer alone can require months of engineering effort.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.2 Consensus Algorithm</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>From scratch means you implement:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake logic</li>  \n<li>Block proposal, voting, and finality</li>  \n<li>Fork choice rules</li>  \n<li>Difficulty or validator rotation</li>  \n<li>Security assumptions</li>  \n<li>Recovery logic</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Bitcoin uses PoW with a simple longest-chain rule, while modern chains often use BFT-style consensus, which is significantly more complex.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.3 Mempool &amp; Transaction Lifecycle</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>You need to define:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Transaction format</li>  \n<li>Validation logic</li>  \n<li>Prioritization rules</li>  \n<li>Fee market design</li>  \n<li>Relay policies</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>This becomes even more challenging if you support smart contracts.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.4 State Machine</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Either a:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>UTXO model (like Bitcoin)</li>  \n<li>Account model (like Ethereum)</li>  \n<li>Hybrid or custom model</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>State transition functions must be deterministic, secure, and efficient.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.5 Cryptography</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>A custom chain requires decisions about:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Signature schemes</li>  \n<li>Hashing algorithms</li>  \n<li>Merkle tree construction</li>  \n<li>Key management</li>  \n<li>Wallet compatibility</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Bitcoin uses ECDSA secp256k1 and SHA-256 double hashing. Many chains today use Ed25519, BLS signatures, or STARK/STARK-friendly hash functions.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.6 Storage &amp; Database Layers</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>You must implement or integrate:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Block storage</li>  \n<li>Indexing</li>  \n<li>State database</li>  \n<li>Pruning</li>  \n<li>Archival modes</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Ethereum, for example, uses LevelDB/RocksDB with complex trie structures optimized over years.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.7 Node Instrumentation</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>A production-grade blockchain node needs:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>RPC server</li>  \n<li>WebSocket endpoints</li>  \n<li>Debug API</li>  \n<li>Logging and metrics</li>  \n<li>Prometheus integration</li>  \n<li>Monitoring and telemetry</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Without these, external developers cannot build on your chain.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>1.8 Wallet Infrastructure</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>You need to provide:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Keypair generation</li>  \n<li>Signing utilities</li>  \n<li>Address formats</li>  \n<li>Hardware wallet integrations</li>  \n<li>Client libraries</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Building a blockchain from scratch means building all of this.</p>  \n  \n<p>It is fundamentally a distributed systems engineering project, not a Crypto Twitter idea.</p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>2. Why SDKs exist (and why most chains use them)</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>Modern blockchain SDKs exist to save developers from rebuilding components that have already been solved millions of times.</p>  \n  \n<p>A framework like Cosmos SDK or Substrate already includes:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Peer-to-peer networking</li>  \n<li>Production-tested consensus</li>  \n<li>RPC and gRPC servers</li>  \n<li>Modular governance</li>  \n<li>IBC or cross-chain communication</li>  \n<li>Staking and slashing</li>  \n<li>WASM or EVM execution environments</li>  \n<li>State management and storage layers</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Using an SDK provides:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Faster development times</li>  \n<li>Safer consensus implementation</li>  \n<li>Easier upgrades</li>  \n<li>Existing toolchains</li>  \n<li>Wallet compatibility</li>  \n<li>Easier validator bootstrapping</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Today, more than 90% of new blockchains are built on one of these frameworks. Entire L1 ecosystems such as Osmosis, Sei, Evmos, Injective, and dYdX are built using the Cosmos SDK.</p>  \n  \n<p>The reason is simple: <strong>developers want to build chains, not reinvent distributed networking from scratch.</strong></p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>3. The dependency misconception</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>A common concern is:<br>  \n“If I use Cosmos SDK or Substrate, am I dependent on their codebase?”</p>  \n  \n<p>The truth is more nuanced. SDKs are <em>open-source frameworks</em>, not proprietary platforms.<br>  \nYou can:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Fork the code</li>  \n<li>Modify modules</li>  \n<li>Replace consensus</li>  \n<li>Build custom state machines</li>  \n<li>Write new modules in Go or Rust</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>This is no different from building a web server on top of Linux instead of writing your own operating system.<br>  \nYou are not dependent; you are leveraging battle-tested engineering.</p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>4. When it makes sense to build from scratch</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>Despite the complexity, there are legitimate reasons to build your own blockchain from zero.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>4.1 You are designing new consensus</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>For example:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>A novel PoW algorithm</li>  \n<li>ASIC-resistant mining</li>  \n<li>New BFT variants</li>  \n<li>DAG-based systems</li>  \n<li>Order-fairness consensus like Pulp Systems or Wimble</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>4.2 You need a fully custom architecture</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Examples:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Bitcoin’s UTXO model</li>  \n<li>Nano’s block-lattice</li>  \n<li>Kadena’s braided chains</li>  \n<li>Solana’s proof-of-history timestamping</li>  \n<li>Chia’s proof-of-space</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>4.3 You want full control of networking</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Especially relevant for:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>IoT blockchains</li>  \n<li>On-premises or air-gapped systems</li>  \n<li>Ultra-low-latency trading chains</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>4.4 You are building a research chain or academic project</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Building from scratch is the best way to understand blockchain internals at a low level.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>4.5 You want to avoid existing technical debt</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Some teams believe building a new stack is better than inheriting old architectural compromises.</p>  \n  \n<p>But these are specific cases, not general needs.</p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>5. When using an SDK or framework is the right decision</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>For 99% of modern blockchain projects, the goal is:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Launching a chain that supports smart contracts</li>  \n<li>Providing cheap blockspace</li>  \n<li>Enabling developers to build apps</li>  \n<li>Creating custom tokenomics or modules</li>  \n<li>Interoperability with other ecosystems</li>  \n<li>Setting up validators and RPC infrastructure</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>If this describes your use case, writing your own P2P networking library or consensus engine provides no additional value.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  The Priority in 2026 is:  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Fewer teams care about reinventing block propagation.<br>  \nThey care about:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>throughput</li>  \n<li>tooling</li>  \n<li>developer experience</li>  \n<li>stability</li>  \n<li>interoperability</li>  \n<li>predictable upgrades</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>And these are areas where SDKs excel.</p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>6. The engineering cost of “from scratch”</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>If your goal is a production-grade chain, here are realistic numbers:</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>Team Requirement</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>3–6 core protocol engineers</li>  \n<li>2 distributed systems engineers</li>  \n<li>1–2 cryptographers</li>  \n<li>3 devops + SRE for network ops</li>  \n<li>2 QA engineers</li>  \n<li>1 project manager</li>  \n<li>1 documentation engineer</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>Timeframe</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Minimum 18–36 months for mainnet</li>  \n<li>Additional 12 months for tooling, wallets, SDKs</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>Cost Breakdown</strong>  \n</h3>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Engineering salaries (core protocol): $2–5M</li>  \n<li>Infrastructure (testnet &amp; mainnet): $200k+</li>  \n<li>Security audits: $300k–$1M</li>  \n<li>Maintenance: ongoing costs</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>This is why frameworks dominate.<br>  \nNot because developers are “lazy”, but because <strong>rebuilding the entire Bitcoin stack is prohibitively expensive unless you are innovating at the protocol level.</strong></p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>7. The hybrid approach: what most serious chains do today</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>Many successful blockchains take an in-between approach:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Use an SDK for networking and consensus</li>  \n<li>Replace or extend the execution environment</li>  \n<li>Write custom modules</li>  \n<li>Write a custom mempool or fee mechanism</li>  \n<li>Modify state machine logic</li>  \n<li>Add their own governance logic</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Examples:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>dYdX replaced CosmWasm with a custom Rust engine</li>  \n<li>Celestia uses Cosmos SDK but created a new DA layer</li>  \n<li>Aptos built a new VM but reused classical networking</li>  \n<li>Arbitrum Orbit uses OP Stack + custom proving logic</li>  \n<li>Sei modified mempool design for parallel execution</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>You avoid rewriting everything while still achieving deep differentiation.</p>  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n<h1>  \n    \n    \n  <strong>8. Conclusion</strong>  \n</h1>  \n  \n<p>Building a blockchain from scratch is technically possible and still relevant for certain categories of projects, particularly when designing novel consensus or architectures. However, in 2026, most blockchains do not need to reimplement Bitcoin’s network or Ethereum’s fundamental components. The ecosystem has matured to the point where leveraging frameworks is not a shortcut but an industry standard.</p>  \n  \n<p>If your goal is to launch a secure, scalable chain with modern tooling, smart contract support, and interoperability, using a mature SDK is the effective path.<br>  \nIf your goal is fundamental protocol innovation or academic exploration, building from scratch remains a valuable pursuit.</p>  \n  \n<p>The key question is not whether you <em>can</em> build a blockchain from scratch, but whether it is the best use of your engineering time in an ecosystem where mature, open-source frameworks already exist.</p>"

Your content ranks #1 for a high-value keyword. You're celebrating with overpriced coffee. Then you check analytics and... nothing. Zero clicks.</p>  \n  \n<p>Welcome to zero-click search, where winning means Google answered the question so well that nobody needs to visit your website. <em>Chef's kiss</em> for user experience. Absolute nightmare for your traffic metrics.</p>  \n  \n<p>But here's the thing—this isn't going away. By late 2025, we're seeing AI Overviews (Google's fancy term for AI-generated answer boxes) on roughly 15-20% of queries. Featured snippets? They've been eating our lunch since 2017. And if you think this trend reverses in 2026, I have a metaverse timeshare to sell you.</p>  \n  \n<p>The question isn't whether to optimize for zero-click results. It's how to do it without tanking your entire content strategy.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Why Zero-Click Actually Matters (Even Though It Hurts)  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>I know what you're thinking. \"Why would I optimize for something that doesn't send traffic?\" Fair question. Here's why you don't have a choice.</p>  \n  \n<p>First, visibility still counts. When your brand shows up in an AI Overview or featured snippet, you're getting prime real estate. Position zero. The penthouse suite of search results. Even if users don't click through immediately, they're seeing your brand as the authority.</p>  \n  \n<p>Second—and this surprised me when I dug into the data—featured snippets actually increase branded search. Users see you as the answer source, then search your brand name directly later. It's indirect traffic, but it's real. One client saw a 34% increase in branded searches three months after consistently winning featured snippets in their niche.</p>  \n  \n<p>Third, you're playing defense. If you don't optimize for these positions, your competitors will. And once they own that snippet real estate, clawing it back is brutal.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  How AI Overviews Actually Work (The Technical Stuff)  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Google's AI Overviews pull from multiple sources to generate answers. They're not just grabbing your meta description and calling it a day. The system is:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Analyzing top-ranking pages for the query</li>  \n<li>Extracting relevant information across multiple sources</li>  \n<li>Synthesizing an answer using large language models</li>  \n<li>Citing sources (sometimes) with small attribution links</li>  \n<li>Prioritizing content that's structured, clear, and authoritative</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>The algorithm favors content that's already ranking well organically. You can't hack your way into an AI Overview from page 47. But if you're on page 1, especially positions 1-5, you're in the game.</p>  \n  \n<p>One critical detail: AI Overviews love recency. Fresh content gets weighted heavily for trending topics or news-related queries. That blog post from 2019? Not making the cut unless you've updated it recently.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The Featured Snippet Playbook (What Still Works)  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Featured snippets are the OG zero-click result. We've had years to figure these out, and the fundamentals haven't changed much:</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Structure matters more than you think.</strong> Use clear H2s and H3s that match question formats. \"What is X?\" \"How to Y?\" \"Why does Z happen?\" Google loves content that mirrors how people actually search.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Answer the question immediately.</strong> Don't bury your answer in paragraph three after telling the entire history of the internet. First 50-60 words should directly address the query. Then you can add context and depth.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Lists and tables perform exceptionally well.</strong> If your content can be formatted as a numbered list, bullet points, or a comparison table, do it. These formats are snippet candy. I've seen mediocre content win snippets purely because it was structured as a clean table while better content was buried in paragraphs.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>The 40-60 word sweet spot is real.</strong> Featured snippet answers typically fall in this range. Too short and you're not providing value. Too long and Google truncates or skips you.</p>  \n  \n<p>Here's what changed in 2025: Google started pulling snippets from video content more aggressively. If you have a YouTube video that answers the query clearly in the first 30 seconds, with good captions, you're now competing for snippet real estate. This opened up a whole new optimization vector.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Optimizing for AI Overview Citations  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>This is where it gets interesting. Because AI Overviews synthesize from multiple sources, you're not trying to \"win\" the entire overview. You're trying to get cited as one of the authoritative sources.</p>  \n  \n<p>The winning strategy I've seen work:</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Create genuinely comprehensive content.</strong> AI models favor sources that cover a topic thoroughly with supporting evidence. Thin content doesn't cut it. You need depth, examples, data points. The kind of content that takes actual expertise to create.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Use clear attribution for data and claims.</strong> When you cite statistics or research, be specific. \"According to a 2025 study...\" is better than \"Research shows...\" AI models pick up on this specificity and are more likely to cite you as a reliable source.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Answer related questions within your content.</strong> Don't just answer one query. Address the logical follow-up questions. If someone searches \"how to optimize for featured snippets,\" they probably also want to know what featured snippets are, why they matter, and how long it takes to see results. Cover the cluster.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Update frequently.</strong> I mentioned this earlier, but it's critical. Set calendar reminders to refresh your top-performing content every 3-6 months. Add new examples, update statistics, incorporate recent developments. AI Overviews have a strong recency bias.</p>  \n  \n<p>One client in the B2B SaaS space started getting cited in AI Overviews after we restructured their content to include more original research and data points. They weren't just rehashing the same advice everyone else was giving—they were adding proprietary insights from their customer data. That originality made them cite-worthy.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The Schema Markup Advantage  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Schema markup is like leaving breadcrumbs for Google's algorithms. It helps search engines understand exactly what your content is about and how it's structured.</p>  \n  \n<p>For zero-click optimization, focus on:</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>FAQ schema</strong> for question-and-answer content. This directly feeds into how AI Overviews structure information. Plus, it can trigger those expandable FAQ sections in search results.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>HowTo schema</strong> for instructional content. Step-by-step guides with proper schema markup have a much higher chance of appearing in AI-generated answers.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Article schema</strong> with proper headline, author, and date published markup. This helps establish content freshness and authority.</p>  \n  \n<p>The implementation isn't rocket science. Tools like Schema.org have templates. Most modern CMS platforms have plugins that handle it. The hard part is actually doing it consistently across your content library.</p>  \n  \n<p>One caveat: Schema markup alone won't save poorly written content. It's an amplifier, not a substitute for quality. Think of it as making sure Google can properly read your already-good content.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  When Zero-Click Becomes a Traffic Problem  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Let's address the elephant in the room. What do you do when you're winning featured snippets and AI Overview citations, but your traffic is tanking?</p>  \n  \n<p>First, measure what actually matters. If you're a lead generation business, track conversions, not just traffic. Sometimes fewer, more qualified visitors convert better than high traffic volumes. I've seen cases where traffic dropped 20% but leads increased 15% because the remaining traffic was more targeted.</p>  \n  \n<p>Second, optimize for the click-through on zero-click results. Yes, that sounds contradictory. But even in AI Overviews, there are citation links. Make sure:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>Your brand name is clearly visible in citations</li>  \n<li>The preview text (if shown) is compelling</li>  \n<li>Your meta description still works hard even if it's not the primary display</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<p>Third, diversify your content strategy. Create content that <em>can't</em> be answered in a snippet. In-depth analyses, original research, interactive tools, comprehensive guides that require scrolling. The kind of content where the snippet is just a teaser.</p>  \n  \n<p>One e-commerce client dealt with this by creating \"quick answer\" content optimized for snippets, then linking to detailed product guides and comparison tools that required site visits. The snippets built authority and brand awareness. The deeper content drove conversions.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The 2026 Playbook: Practical Next Steps  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Here's what's actually working as we head into 2026:</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Audit your current snippet performance.</strong> Tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs show you which keywords trigger featured snippets and whether you're winning them. Start there. Low-hanging fruit is content where you rank positions 2-5 for queries with existing snippets.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Create a \"snippet content\" category.</strong> Not every piece of content needs to chase zero-click optimization. But identify 20-30 high-value queries in your niche where winning the snippet or AI Overview citation would build authority. Build content specifically for these.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Implement a refresh cadence.</strong> Set up a system to update your top-performing content quarterly. Add new data, fresh examples, recent developments. This keeps you competitive for AI Overviews that favor recency.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Test video content for snippet opportunities.</strong> Create short, well-captioned videos that directly answer common questions in your niche. Upload to YouTube with optimized titles and descriptions. This is an underutilized vector for 2026.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Track indirect metrics.</strong> Set up custom reports in Google Analytics to track branded search increases, conversion rate changes, and time-to-conversion shifts. Zero-click optimization affects these metrics even when traffic stays flat.</p>  \n  \n<p><strong>Build content clusters, not individual posts.</strong> Create comprehensive topic clusters where your pillar content can get cited in AI Overviews, and your supporting content captures the long-tail traffic that still generates clicks. This is essentially what we covered in our <a href=\"https://example.com/ai-content-marketing-guide\">AI in Content Marketing: 2025 Strategy Guide</a>—the principles apply directly to zero-click optimization.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  The Uncomfortable Truth About 2026  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Here's what I've learned after a year of obsessing over this: Zero-click search isn't the enemy. It's just a different game.</p>  \n  \n<p>The old model was simple. Rank high, get clicks, convert visitors. Linear and measurable.</p>  \n  \n<p>The new model is messier. Build authority through zero-click visibility, earn brand recognition, capture traffic through multiple touchpoints, convert over longer timelines. It's harder to attribute. It requires more patience. The metrics don't look as pretty in your monthly reports.</p>  \n  \n<p>But the businesses winning in 2026 aren't the ones fighting this trend. They're the ones who figured out how to use AI Overviews and featured snippets as top-of-funnel brand building, then created content strategies that capture demand at every other stage.</p>  \n  \n<p>You can't optimize your way back to 2015 when every search sent traffic. That world is gone. The question is whether you'll adapt your strategy or keep chasing metrics that matter less every quarter.</p>  \n  \n<p>Start with one high-value query in your niche. Optimize that content for zero-click results using the frameworks above. Measure what happens to branded search and conversions over 90 days. Then scale what works.</p>  \n  \n<p>The traffic might not come directly from that featured snippet. But if you're doing it right, it'll come.</p>"

The real challenge is the frustrating \"No Usable Data Found\" error that appears even when the scan seems to work.</p>  \n  \n<p>This error signals a shift from simple scanning problems to complex data-layer failures. This guide breaks down the advanced reasons these errors happen now and what you can do about them.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Understanding the \"No Usable Data Found\" QR Code Error  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Getting this error doesn't mean your phone's camera is broken. It means your device read the code but couldn't understand or access the information it pointed to. The bridge between the physical code and the digital experience is down.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  What \"No Usable Data Found\" Actually Means  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>This message indicates a data retrieval failure. Your scanner app successfully decoded the pattern but found the resulting information to be empty, corrupted, or inaccessible. It's like following a map to a location only to find an empty lot where a building should be.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  A Quick Look at How QR Codes Work  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>A QR code is a visual storage device. It encodes information like a web address, text, or contact details into a black-and-white pixelated square. When you scan it, your device's app translates that pattern back into its original data and attempts to act on it, like opening a website.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Common Causes for QR Code Scan Failures in 2026  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>While old-school issues still exist, the reasons for scan failures in 2026 are far more advanced. They often involve the complex data and experiences linked to the code itself.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Poor QR Code Print Quality or Physical Damage  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>A classic problem that persists. Scratches, poor contrast, or blurry printing can make a code unreadable. If the code is printed on a glossy surface with heavy glare, scanners can also struggle to decode the pattern correctly.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Outdated or Incompatible QR Code Scanner Applications  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Many modern QR codes link to advanced experiences like augmented reality (AR) or blockchain assets. If your scanner app hasn't been updated, it may not support these new data types, resulting in an error even if the code itself is fine.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Incorrect QR Code Generation and Data Encoding  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>This is a creator-side error. If the data was entered incorrectly when the QR code was made, it will point to a nonexistent link or contain garbled text. The code is generated perfectly, but the information inside is flawed from the start.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Issues with the Scanning Device Camera  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>A dirty camera lens is a common culprit. Smudges or dirt can obstruct the camera's view, preventing it from clearly seeing the entire QR code pattern. Low-light conditions can also make it difficult for the camera to focus properly.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Environmental Interference During Scanning  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Scanning a code from too far away or at a sharp angle can cause failures. Insufficient lighting, shadows, or even a shaky hand can prevent the app from capturing a stable image of the code to analyze.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Data Incompatibility or Corrupted Information  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>This is a major issue in 2026. A QR code might link to a 3D model for an AR experience that your phone doesn't support. It could also point to a digital asset on a blockchain, but the data is inaccessible because the network is congested or the data format is wrong.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Server-Side Problems with Dynamic QR Codes  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Dynamic QR codes point to a URL that then redirects to the final content. This allows the destination to be updated. But if the server managing this redirect is down or misconfigured, your scan will lead nowhere. Ensuring a stable backend is essential, a task often handled through expert <a href=\"https://indiit.com/mobile-app-development-texas/\">mobile app development texas</a> to build reliable systems.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Application or Platform Specific Restrictions  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Data privacy rules are stricter than ever. A QR code might be blocked from showing data because you haven't given consent per GDPR or CCPA rules. Similarly, authenticator apps like Microsoft Authenticator can fail if there are security restrictions or time synchronization issues with your account.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Practical Solutions to Resolve \"No Usable Data Found\" Errors  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>Fixing these new-age QR code errors involves looking beyond the physical scan. Here are practical steps for both users and creators to solve the problem.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Essential Troubleshooting Steps for Users  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Start with the basics. Clean your phone's camera lens with a soft cloth. Check that you have a stable internet connection, as many QR codes require it. Try restarting the scanner app or your phone to clear any temporary glitches.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Optimizing Your QR Code Scanning Environment  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Ensure you are in a well-lit area without harsh shadows or glare. Position your phone directly in front of the code, not at an angle. Move closer or farther away until the camera focuses clearly and the entire code is visible in the frame.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Updating or Choosing a Better QR Code Scanner App  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>If you suspect the issue is data incompatibility, check for updates to your scanner app. Consider using your phone's native camera app, as it's often updated with the operating system to support new technologies like AR.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Verifying and Regenerating the QR Code  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>If you created the QR code, double-check the source data for typos or errors. Use a different device to scan and test the code yourself. If the data is incorrect, you will need to generate a new QR code with the corrected information.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Addressing Device Camera Malfunctions  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Open your regular camera app and see if it focuses correctly on other objects. If your camera is blurry or unable to focus, you may have a hardware issue that requires professional repair.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Checking Data Availability for Dynamic QR Codes  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>If a QR code for a service or event isn't working, check the company's official website or social media for any announced outages. The problem may be with their server, not your device.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Contacting Support for Specific Application Services  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>For issues with secure apps like authenticators or banking apps, the problem is likely account-specific. Contact the application's support team directly, as they can check for server-side issues or security flags on your account.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Preventing Future \"No Usable Data Found\" QR Code Issues  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>A few smart habits can help you avoid these errors, whether you are creating QR codes or just scanning them.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Best Practices for Generating High-Quality QR Codes  \n</h3>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>Use Dynamic Codes:</strong> Always choose dynamic QR codes over static ones. This lets you fix typos or update the destination link without having to reprint the code.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Ensure High Resolution:</strong> Export your QR code as a vector file (like SVG or EPS) to ensure it stays sharp at any size.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Add a Quiet Zone:</strong> Leave a clear, empty margin around the QR code. This \"quiet zone\" helps scanners distinguish the code from its surroundings.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Smart Scanning Habits for Consistent Results  \n</h3>  \n  \n<ul>  \n<li>  <strong>Use the Native Camera:</strong> Your phone's built-in camera app is usually the most reliable and up-to-date scanner.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Be Aware of Context:</strong> If a QR code promises an AR experience, be prepared for it to require more processing power and a strong internet connection.</li>  \n<li>  <strong>Don't Scan Suspicious Codes:</strong> Be cautious about scanning random QR codes from untrusted sources, as they can lead to phishing sites.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Frequently Asked Questions About QR Code Scan Errors  \n</h2>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Why Is My iPhone Not Scanning QR Codes  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>First, check your iPhone's settings. Go to Settings &gt; Camera and ensure \"Scan QR Codes\" is enabled. If it is, the issue could be a dirty lens, poor lighting, or an outdated iOS version that doesn't support the QR code's linked data type.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  What Causes \"No Usable Data Found\" on Microsoft Authenticator  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>This error on an authenticator app is almost always a server-side or account-sync issue. It can be caused by the time on your device being out of sync with the server, a temporary service outage, or an invalid activation code from the service you're trying to add.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  Can a QR Code Expire or Become Invalid  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>A static QR code, which has the data embedded directly, never expires. However, a dynamic QR code points to a web link that can be changed or deleted. If that link is broken or the service is discontinued, the QR code will effectively \"expire\" and lead to an error.</p>  \n  \n<h3>  \n    \n    \n  How Can I Test a QR Code Before Deployment  \n</h3>  \n  \n<p>Always test your QR code before printing it. Scan it with multiple devices (both iPhone and Android) and different scanner apps. Ensure it leads to the correct destination and that all content loads properly on a mobile device.</p>  \n  \n<h2>  \n    \n    \n  Conclusion  \n</h2>  \n  \n<p>The \"No Usable Data Found\" error in 2026 marks a shift in how we interact with QR codes. The problem is no longer just about a successful scan but about the reliability of the complex digital experiences they unlock, from personalized content to AR and blockchain data.</p>  \n  \n<p>Understanding these new failure points is key. For users, it means checking app compatibility and internet connections. For creators, it demands a focus on robust backends and testing across multiple platforms.</p>  \n  \n<p>Start by using your phone's native camera for scans and ensuring your apps are always up to date. This prepares your device to handle the advanced, data-rich world that QR codes now connect us to.</p>"

The idea here is you clone (i.e. copy) the code you’re going to work on onto your own computer, then you can make your necessary changes, then lastly save it back to the official code repository. In other words, you take the copied code and “branch” off with it to make changes. Then you “merge” your branch back into the main repository of code.</p>  \n  \n<p>In my old job, Pega handled this on it’s own. It had it’s own branching tools, so I could copy the low code settings into my own branch, make my changes, then check them back in to the official code. But outside of low-code tools like Pega, developers primarily use git to help manage their branch development.</p>  \n  \n<p>With 100Devs, I’ve been pushing the HTML and CSS projects into Github. In the past, I would not create branches. I would just clone the code down, make changes, then merge the code straight into the main branch without creating my own branches or opening a pull request. While that would work for small one-developer projects, that won’t work long-term in my learning.</p>  \n  \n<p>Below is the workflow I’ve been using for the past few weeks. I’m writing this mainly for myself — I forget the terminal commands sometimes and will need a reminder. But hopefully this can also help you, the reader, if you are just starting out and learning git.</p>  \n  \n<p><code>git checkout -b &lt;branchName&gt;</code> : This command does two things — it first creates a new branch with whatever value you provide (without the &lt; and &gt; symbols), and it automatically checks out your code into this new branch.</p>  \n  \n<p><code>git branch</code> : This will list out all the branches you have. The branch you are currently working in might have a * beside it’s name, be colored green, or be bolded in the terminal.</p>  \n  \n<p><code>git status</code> : This shows all the updated files that are not staged for the next commit. Usually a terminal will show these files in the color red.</p>  \n  \n<p><code>git add &lt;fileName&gt; or git add .</code> : The first command adds a specific file name to the staging area for the next commit. The second command adds everything that’s been changed. Be careful with the second command, as you may not want to add everything for the next commit quite yet.</p>  \n  \n<p><code>git commit -m “&lt;commit message&gt;”</code> : This commits the changes in git.

To demonstrate the effectiveness, we train an RL agent to perform composition-conserving atomic swap actions on the icosahedral nanoparticle structure. Trained once on randomised $Ag_{X}Au_{309-X}$ compositions and orderings, the agent discovers previously established ground state structure. We show that this optimization is robust to differently ordered initialisations of the same NP compositions. We also demonstrate that a trained policy can extrapolate effectively to NPs of unseen size. However, the efficacy is limited when multiple alloying elements are involved. Our results demonstrate that RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can navigate combinatorial ordering spaces at the nanoparticle scale, and offer a transferable optimisation strategy with the potential to generalise across composition and reduce repeated individual search cost."

In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics."

The system employs a background water flow into which three dye colors are injected and symbols are detected by a multi-wavelength photosensor. A zero-forcing--based estimator is used to separate the spectral components and reliably identify the transmitted colors. The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel. The proposed testbed demonstrates that fundamental principles of MC can be taught effectively using a compact and inexpensive experimental setup. The experiment will be integrated into an undergraduate lab course."

We achieve this through an involved subroutine for merging partial solutions at union nodes in the expression. In the usual way this results in a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm for solving the decision problem in the same time. We complement these by a matching lower bound under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). This closes an open question that appeared multiple times in the literature [ESA 23, ICALP 24, IPEC 25]. \n  We also present an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a tree decomposition of width $k$ of $G$, in time $O(3^kn^c)$ counts modulo $2$ the number of feedback vertex sets of $G$ of each size. This matches the known SETH-tight bound for the decision version, which was obtained using the celebrated cut-and-count technique [FOCS 11, TALG 22]. Unlike other applications of cut-and-count, which use the isolation lemma to reduce a decision problem to counting solutions modulo $2$, this bound was obtained via counting other objects, leaving the complexity of counting solutions modulo $2$ open. \n  Finally, we present a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k$-clique expression of $G$, in time $O(18^kn^c)$ decides the existence of a connected feedback vertex set of size $b$ in $G$.

Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \\textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a \"low-bit\" exploration phase and a \"high-precision\" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning."

We present a cross-lingual interleaving method that mixes speech tokens across languages without textual supervision. We also release an EN-FR training dataset, TinyStories (~42k hours), together with EN-FR spoken StoryCloze and TopicCloze benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic evaluation, both synthetically generated using GPT-4.

We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors.

In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $α$ and the variable selection ratio $ρ$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = αN$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = ρN$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $ρN$ dimensions can separate $αN$ random patterns if and only if $α&lt; 2ρ$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings."

In this paper, we give an induced counterpart of the Forest Minor theorem: for any $t \\geqslant 2$, the $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free $H$-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ belongs to a class $\\mathcal F$ of forests, which we describe as the induced minors of two (very similar) infinite parameterized families.

Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies."

Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation.

Although peatlands cover only about 3 % of the global land surface, they store more carbon than all the world’s forests combined. When peatlands are drained, a common practice for agriculture, they don’t just release CO₂ once; they leak carbon continuously, year after year. Restoring peatlands thus stops that “constant leak,” and rewetting them can turn a major source of emissions into a long-term carbon sink.</p>  \n  \n<p>But rewetting alone is not enough: farmers need viable, sustainable livelihoods. That’s where Zukunftmoor’s innovative approach comes in. They propose combining rewetting with cultivation of Sphagnum moss — a natural plant of peatlands — which can serve as a sustainable substitute for extracted peat in horticultural substrates. This turns rewetting from a purely ecological restoration act into a market-driven, economically viable land-use model. By using drones or hand-seeding methods, and developing harvesting and substrate-supply chains, the approach offers farmers a low-input, long-term pathway to maintain income while restoring degraded peatlands.</p>  \n  \n<p>With this combination of climate mitigation and practical agriculture, Kasper’s vision offers peatland regions across Europe a concrete alternative to drainage-based farming — one that aligns environmental restoration with economic viability.</p>  \n  \n<p>Original article published on <a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2025/11/11/julia-kasper/\">Investing in Regenerative Agriculture</a>.</p>"

We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets. The observed error patterns also suggest that this task remains challenging and requires further research. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/drthaodao3101/MasHeNe.git."

    "content": "Recent neural audio codecs have achieved impressive reconstruction quality, typically relying on quantization methods such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ). However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design choices."

    "content": "Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation."

    "content": "Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references."

In this work, we extend the simple fractal model, which is particularly useful for describing small cities or individual districts, by constructing random cities based on a tiling structure over which hyperfractals are distributed. This approach enables the connection of multiple hyperfractal districts, providing a more comprehensive urban representation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this decomposition can be used to segment a city into distinct districts through fractal analysis. Finally, we present tools for the numerical generation of random cities following this model."

Like, at all. You just tell the button what element to control and what to do with it. That’s the whole thing.</p> \n \n<p>It’s wild that this hasn’t existed until now.</p> \n \n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://codepen.io/web-strategist/embed/vEGrYbZ?height=600&amp;default-tab=result&amp;embed-version=2\"> \n</iframe> \n</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>How We’ve Been Doing It (The Old Way)</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Right now, if you want a button to open a dialog, you’re writing code like this:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>const button = document.querySelector('#open-button'); \nconst dialog = document.querySelector('#my-dialog'); \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>button.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; { \n  dialog.showModal(); \n}); \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>It works, but come on. That’s way too much ceremony for “button opens thing.”</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>How Invokers Work (The New Way)</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>You add two attributes to your button, and you’re done:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;button commandfor=\"my-dialog\" command=\"show-modal\"&gt; \n  Open Dialog \n&lt;/button&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;dialog id=\"my-dialog\"&gt; \n  &lt;h2&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;This dialog opened without a single line of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;button commandfor=\"my-dialog\" command=\"close\"&gt; \n    Close This \n  &lt;/button&gt; \n&lt;/dialog&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>That’s it. The button just knows what to do. No JavaScript file. No event listeners, no querying the DOM. It’s beautiful.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>A Real-World Example</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Here’s something you’d actually build — a settings menu with a popover:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;button commandfor=\"settings-menu\" command=\"toggle-popover\"&gt; \n  ⚙️ Settings \n&lt;/button&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"settings-menu\" popover&gt; \n  &lt;h3&gt;Settings&lt;/h3&gt; \n  &lt;label&gt; \n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\"&gt; Dark Mode \n  &lt;/label&gt; \n  &lt;label&gt; \n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\"&gt; Notifications \n  &lt;/label&gt; \n  &lt;label&gt; \n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\"&gt; Auto-save \n  &lt;/label&gt; \n  &lt;button commandfor=\"settings-menu\" command=\"hide-popover\"&gt; \n    Done \n  &lt;/button&gt; \n&lt;/div&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Click the settings button, the menu pops up. Click Done, it closes. Zero JavaScript required. This used to take 20+ lines of code.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>The Attributes</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>There are two attributes that make this magic happen:</p> \n \n<p>`<code> - This points to the ID of whatever you want to control. So if you want to control a dialog with </code>id=\"my-dialog\"<code>, you write </code>commandfor=\"my-dialog\"`.</p> \n \n<p>`<code> - This is what you want to happen. Like </code>show-modal<code> to open a dialog, or </code>close<code> to close it, or </code>toggle-popover` for popovers.</p> \n \n<p>That’s literally all you need to know.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>What You Can Control</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Right now, you can control:</p> \n \n<p><strong>Dialogs: </strong><code>show-modal</code> and <code>close</code> work right out of the box. Finally.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Popovers: </strong><code>show-popover</code>, <code>hide-popover</code>, and <code>toggle-popover</code>. Super clean.</p> \n \n<p><strong>Details Elements: </strong><code>open</code>, <code>close</code>, and <code>toggle</code> for accordion-style content.</p> \n \n<p>And they’re adding more. File inputs, video controls, all that stuff is coming.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Custom Commands Are Cool Too</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>You can make up your own commands. They just need to start with two dashes:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;button commandfor=\"photo\" command=\"--flip-horizontal\"&gt; \n  Flip Photo \n&lt;/button&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;button commandfor=\"photo\" command=\"--rotate-90\"&gt; \n  Rotate 90° \n&lt;/button&gt;&lt;img id=\"photo\" src=\"vacation.jpg\" alt=\"Beach photo\"&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>Then you write a little JavaScript to listen for these custom commands and do whatever you want:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>document.getElementById('photo').addEventListener('command', (e) =&gt; { \n  if (e.command === '--flip-horizontal') { \n    e.target.style.transform = 'scaleX(-1)'; \n  } else if (e.command === '--rotate-90') { \n    e.target.style.transform = 'rotate(90deg)'; \n  } \n}); \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>But the whole click-handling setup is already done for you, which is nice.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Another Solid Example: Image Gallery</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Here’s a complete image gallery with next/previous buttons:<br> \n</p> \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"gallery\"&gt; \n  &lt;button commandfor=\"gallery-dialog\" command=\"show-modal\"&gt; \n    📷 View Gallery \n  &lt;/button&gt; \n&lt;/div&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n \n \n<div> \n<pre><code>&lt;dialog id=\"gallery-dialog\"&gt; \n  &lt;div class=\"gallery-content\"&gt; \n    &lt;img id=\"current-image\" src=\"photo-1.jpg\" alt=\"Gallery photo\"&gt; \n \n    &lt;div class=\"controls\"&gt; \n      &lt;button commandfor=\"current-image\" command=\"--previous\"&gt; \n        ← Previous \n      &lt;/button&gt; \n      &lt;button commandfor=\"current-image\" command=\"--next\"&gt; \n        Next → \n      &lt;/button&gt; \n      &lt;button commandfor=\"gallery-dialog\" command=\"close\"&gt; \n        ✕ Close \n      &lt;/button&gt; \n    &lt;/div&gt; \n  &lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;/dialog&gt; \n</code></pre> \n \n</div> \n \n \n \n<p>The dialog opens and closes with built-in commands. The next/previous buttons use custom commands that you’d wire up with a few lines of JavaScript. But all the button-clicking mechanics? Already handled.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Browser Support Right Now</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Here’s where things stand:</p> \n \n<ul> \n<li> \n<strong>Chrome Canary 134+</strong> Turn on the experimental flag</li> \n<li> \n<strong>Firefox Nightly 135+</strong> Enable the flag</li> \n<li> \n<strong>Safari Technology Preview </strong>Flag it on</li> \n</ul> \n \n<p>It’s in the experimental phase, but it’s moving fast. This should be available everywhere by mid-2025.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Why This Is Actually a Big Deal</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>Look, this isn’t changing the world or anything. But it’s fixing something that’s been annoying for years.</p> \n \n<p>Buttons controlling other elements is foundational web stuff. We shouldn’t need to import libraries or write boilerplate for it. HTML should just handle it. And now it does.</p> \n \n<p>Plus, when stuff is built into the platform, accessibility comes for free. Screen readers work better with it. Keyboard navigation just works. You don’t have to remember to add all the ARIA attributes.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>Real Talk</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>This is one of those features that makes you go “wait, this wasn’t already a thing?” Because it feels so obvious once you see it.</p> \n \n<p>The web platform is finally catching up to what we’ve been doing with JavaScript frameworks for years. And that’s great because it means less JavaScript to ship, less code to maintain, and websites that just work better.</p> \n \n<p>Invokers are simple, they’re elegant, and they’re about to be everywhere. Get ready to delete a bunch of event listeners.</p> \n \n<h2> \n   \n   \n  <strong>The Bottom Line</strong> \n</h2> \n \n<p>HTML Invokers let buttons control stuff without JavaScript. Two attributes. No libraries. It’s clean, it’s simple, and it’s coming to browsers near you.</p> \n \n<p>This is the kind of improvement that makes web development just a little bit more fun. And honestly? We could use more of that.</p> \n \n<blockquote> \n<p><strong><em>Did you learn something good today as a developer?</em></strong><br> \n<em>Then show some love.</em><br> \n<em>© </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/m/in/muhammad-usman-strategist/\"><em>Muhammad Usman</em></a><br> \n<strong><em>WordPress Developer | Website Strategist | SEO Specialist</em></strong><br> \n<em>Don’t forget to subscribe to <a href=\"https://developersjourney.substack.com/\">Developer’s Journey</a> to show your support.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n \n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmdae1flujul96o4a41v1.png\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmdae1flujul96o4a41v1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"266\"></a></p>"

Merely presenting static information often falls short of creating a memorable user experience. This is where dynamic, interactive elements come into play, transforming passive browsing into an engaging journey. For WordPress users leveraging the power of Elementor, a popular page builder, there's a straightforward yet incredibly effective tool to achieve this: the Flip Box widget. Designed to add a layer of interactivity and visual flair, the Elementor Flip Box allows you to display information in a novel way that encourages exploration and makes your content truly pop.</p>  \n  \n<h3>What is the Elementor Flip Box Widget?</h3>  \n  \n<p>The Elementor Flip Box widget is an innovative design element that presents content on two distinct sides – a 'front' and a 'back' – within a single container. Initially, users see the front side, which typically contains a concise piece of information, an icon, or a brief heading. Upon a specific interaction, usually a hover action or a click, the box animates and 'flips' to reveal the hidden content on its back side. This secondary content often provides more detailed information, a call to action, or supplementary media.</p>  \n  \n<p>As a native feature within Elementor, it's easily accessible for any WordPress user, eliminating the need for complex custom coding to achieve sophisticated interactive effects. Leveraging the Flip Box allows you to condense information into visually appealing, bite-sized chunks, enhancing both aesthetics and functional efficiency. It exemplifies how Elementor empowers users to create professional, dynamic layouts with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, significantly improving the user experience on any WordPress-powered platform.</p>  \n  \n<h3>Elevate Your Design: Key Benefits of Using Elementor Flip Boxes</h3>  \n  \n<p>Integrating the Flip Box widget into your Elementor-built WordPress site offers a multitude of advantages, significantly boosting your site's appeal and effectiveness:</p>  \n  \n<ul>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Enhanced User Engagement:</strong> Its interactive nature naturally draws users in, prompting deeper interaction and content discovery, leading to longer session durations and memorable experiences.</li>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Optimal Space Efficiency:</strong> Flip Boxes effectively present a summary on the front and detailed information on the back, saving valuable screen real estate while maintaining a clean, professional layout.</li>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Increased Visual Appeal:</strong> Offering various flip directions (horizontal, vertical, 3D cube) and customizable animations, Flip Boxes add a modern, dynamic touch, making your site visually distinct and engaging.</li>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Effective Call-to-Actions (CTAs):</strong> The back side is ideal for embedding compelling CTAs or contact information, guiding engaged users seamlessly towards their next step.</li>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Versatile Application:</strong> Incredibly versatile, the Elementor Flip Box widget seamlessly adapts to showcase team bios, product features, services, or FAQs, fitting various content types and design needs across your WordPress website.</li>  \n</ul>  \n  \n<h3>Mastering the Flip Box: Setup &amp; Customization Tips for WordPress Users</h3>  \n  \n<p>Implementing and customizing an Elementor Flip Box on your WordPress site is a straightforward process, thanks to Elementor's intuitive interface. Here’s a basic guide to get you started and some tips for mastery:</p>  \n  \n<ol>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Adding the Widget:</strong> Open your page or post in the Elementor editor. Search for \"Flip Box\" in the widgets panel and drag it onto your canvas.</li>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Content Configuration:</strong> In the 'Content' tab, you'll find options for both the 'Front' and 'Back' sides. For the front, you can add an icon, title, description, and even a button. Repeat this process for the back side, often including a more detailed description or a primary call-to-action. You can also choose your desired 'Flip Effect' (e.g., Slide, Push, Zoom, 3D), 'Flip Direction', and whether it flips on 'Hover' or 'Click'.</li>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Styling for Impact:</strong> The 'Style' tab is where you bring your Flip Box to life. Customize the background (color or image), padding, border, and typography for both the front and back. Adjust the icon and button styles to match your brand's aesthetics. Experiment with different animations and timings to find the perfect balance between subtlety and impact.</li>  \n  <li>  \n<strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Always check how your Flip Box appears on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Elementor's responsive mode. Adjust settings as needed to ensure optimal display and functionality across all screen sizes.</li>  \n</ol>  \n  \n<p>For a deeper dive into all the practical steps, advanced settings, and creative ideas for leveraging this powerful Elementor tool to its fullest potential on your WordPress site, consider exploring comprehensive guides available online. These resources often provide detailed walkthroughs and examples that can significantly enhance your design capabilities. For instance, to dive deeper into the practical steps and creative ideas for leveraging this powerful tool, explore comprehensive guides like this one on the <a href=\"https://artarasaneh.com/flip-box-widget-elementor\">Elementor Flip Box widget</a>.</p>  \n  \n<h3>Conclusion: Transform Your WordPress Site with Elementor Flip Boxes</h3>  \n  \n<p>The Elementor Flip Box widget is more than just a visually appealing element; it's a strategic tool for enhancing user engagement, optimizing content display, and adding a professional polish to any WordPress website. By effectively utilizing its dual-sided design and customizable animations, you can captivate your audience, convey information efficiently, and guide them seamlessly through your site.

    "content": "While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations."
